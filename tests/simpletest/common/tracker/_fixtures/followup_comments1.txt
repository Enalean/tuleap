The freeze mode can be dropped.
Attached a mail answer from Michel Martin

----------------------

Hi Laurent
Quick answer: Old requirement that didn't get cleaned.

Ther freeze-continue is part of the WWF API but is not currently used by the MMA camcorder plug-in.

IMO it can be dropped. Your interpretation is correct. In freeze the encoder keeps encoding the last frame until it receives the releaseFreeze command.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>From MDF reference:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freeze()
virtual void Freeze()=0;

Pre-Condition
""This method can only be called after the hwdevice has been initialized with Initialize().""

Description
Freezes the input picture. Normal encoding can be continued using ReleaseFreeze(). 
*********************
ReleaseFreeze()
virtual void ReleaseFreeze()=0;

Pre-Condition
""This method can only be called after the hwdevice has been initialized with Initialize().""

Description
Releases a frozen input picture. Video capturing and encoding continues normally
