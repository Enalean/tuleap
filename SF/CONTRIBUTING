If you ever make changes to the CodeX code base, please keep us
informed of your changes via email at codex-contact@codex.xerox.com or
even better, submit a patch file with the modifications you made
through our Patch Manager available at:

CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

While we want to encourage you to submit code contributions and patches
to CodeX, we do need to make sure they are cleanly implemented and
make sense in the way they are designed.

When designing your changes, think about a few things:

-Is this scalable? For example, if you want to have a pop-up box
listing groups or users, that obviously would never scale up to CodeX
levels. It might work great if you have 10 projects on your test
version of CodeX, but what happens when you have 10,000?

-Is it secure? When updating or inserting into the database, are you
checking to make sure that the user has permissions to do it and that
they have not hacked your HTML form to get around limited security?

-Is it readable? All your code should be properly indented and if/else
statements should always include braces {}. Vertical linespacing also
helps improve readability and maintainability.

-Is it commented? Did you add simple comments throughout your code
explaining why/how you're approaching the task?

-Is it customizable? When you implement a new feature make sure that
it can be configured to match the needs of a large spectrum of
users. In some cases it may just require a little bit mroe work to
make hundreds of users happy instead of just a couple.

When you prepare your patches, make sure they are tested and known to
work, and make sure that each patch handles basically one feature at a
time. If you group a bunch of features into a single patch, we may not
be able to accept them all, or all at the same time.
