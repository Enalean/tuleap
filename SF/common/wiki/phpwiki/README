HISTORY

For a list of current bugs see:
  https://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=6121

The fastest and out-of-the-box version uses DATABASE_TYPE=dba, 
a dbm file in the /tmp directory; you may wish a more permanent 
place for yours, but make sure it's read/writable by your web server!

NOTE: Not all database versions are equal. The MySQL and Postgresql
implementations have the full set of features; DBM and mSQL are
missing only a few, and the flat file implementation is solid
and waiting for your improvement. All are suitable for production.
