Installing phpwiki with SQLite 
------------------------------

SQLite support is highly experimental but necessary. 

SQLite is from PHP5 on the default database, built in PHP's core. 
MySQL is only a extension module and relatively hard to setup (or 
impossible on certain windows builds such as php-5.0.0b4), similar to dba.
sqlite extensions exist for php-4.3.x but not for 4.2.x
Get the 4..3.x windows dll at http://snaps.php.net/win32/PECL_4_3/php_sqlite.dll

To setup the initial tables you currently need the external sqlite
executable client. On Microsoft Windows download the sqlite.exe binary
from http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.zip
We work on a solution to setup the database on a virgin wiki 
automatically, so that the sqlite binary is not needed anymore.

sqlite /tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.db < schemas/sqlite-initialize.sql

Edit the DATABASE settings in config/config.ini to reflect your settings.

  a) DATABASE_TYPE must be set to 'SQL'.
     ADODB not yet. This is planned for the 1.4.0 release.

  b) DATABASE_DSN should be set to something like
     DATABASE_DSN = "sqlite:////tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.db?mode=0664&persistent=1"

That's it. PhpWiki should now work.

UPGRADING the schema
--------------------

echo ".dump" | sqlite /tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.db > dump.sql
# fix the dump.sql file: adding indices or columns
mv /tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.db /tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.old
sqlite /tmp/phpwiki-sqlite.db < dump.sql
