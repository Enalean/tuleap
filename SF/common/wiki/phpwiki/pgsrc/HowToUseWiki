''"Wiki wiki"'' means "quick" in Hawai'ian.

*All you really need to know is:*

* To edit any page click on the Edit link at the bottom of the page.
  You should do that right now, and read the source code of this page.
  It will make more sense.

* You get italics by surrounding words with underscores on either side
  _like this_.

* You get *bold text* by using two asterisks on either side.

* And, *_bold italics_* by using both.

* You get =monospaced text= by using two equal-signs on either side.

* You get bullets by using an asterisk * at the start of the line.

* To have a paragraph in plain monospaced font, start it with <pre>
  and end it with </pre>:

  <pre>
  this is a poem for sure
  about monospacing
  i wrote in purple velour
  but couldn't find a rhyme for monospacing
  </pre>

* You separate paragraphs with an extra blank line. Example:

  I am a paragraph.

  I am a paragraph too. We're just very small paragraphs.

* You can get horizontal rules with four or more dashes like this:

* To create hyperlinks you just capitalize the words and string them
  together. Let's say you want to create a page about how Steve
  Wainstead eats worms. All you have to do is capitalize each word and
  string them together like this: SteveWainsteadEatsLiveWorms. If the
  page does not exist yet a question mark appears after the link,
  inviting you to create the page: ThisPageShouldNotExist. (And please
  don't ruin the example by creating one.)

* To link to pages outside the Wiki, you can just type in the URL and
  Wiki will link it for you: http://www.nytimes.com/

* To put images in, just provide the hyperlink in brackets like this:
  ~[~http://www.yourhost.yourdomain/images/picture.png]. Image URLs not
  in brackets will just appear as hyperlinks to the image.

* Now you are ready to begin AddingPages.

A WikiWikiWeb is meant to be fast and easy to edit. It has very simple
markup that you can read about in TextFormattingRules.

If you don't like the size of the text editing window you get, you can
change it.  See UserPreferences.
