PhpWiki lets you extend it with new functionality via a plugin mechanism. In short, you extend a PHP class we provide and customize it to print out the content you want. For more information see WikiPlugin, HelloWorldPlugin, and view the source of the files in <tt>/lib/plugin</tt>.

If there is no example page for the plugin, or you need more information, the best place to go is the source of the plugin. Under your wiki's root directory, the folder lib/plugin contains all the PHP files for the plugins.

Some plugins require external libraries not provided with PhpWiki or PHP, such as the GD library for graphics.
