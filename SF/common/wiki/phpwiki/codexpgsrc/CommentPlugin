!!! Synopsis

The CommentPlugin lets you hide parts of a Wiki page without actually
deleting the text. Comments will only be visible in the Wiki markup
when editing or viewing the source.

!!! Usage

Simply place the text to be commented out between =<?plugin Comment=
and =?>=:

<verbatim>
<?plugin Comment

!!! A Hidden Section

This text will not show up in the generated HTML page, but it is still
visible when editing the WikiMarkup.

?>
</verbatim>

!!! Author

<?plugin Comment

!!! "Fuzzy" Logic
Theorem: a cat has nine tails.
Proof:
    No cat has eight tails. A cat has one tail more than no cat.
    Therefore, a cat has nine tails.
