<p>
SourceForge would like to extend an invitation to any Open Source project to be hosted for no price and
no catch. This is our token of appreciation to the people who help make Open Source a reality.
</p>

<p>
<i>Why are we doing this ?</i><br>
A lot of opensource projects were being hosted out of personal ISP accounts, and that was causing a sort
of a growth problem with some projects. They were victims of their own success. When their software or
web site got too popular, they might have to shut it down due to lack of resources. Most people are not
doing this for money, but for other reasons. We have the ability and opportunity to give back to the
community, and we would like to use this opportunity to do so in some way. 
</p>

<p>
<i>What we will provide:</i>
<li>Web Site Space 
<li>E-mail Lists (Public & Private)
<li>CVS support (both anonymous read & secure write)
<li>FTP Server
<li>Project Management Software
<li>Bug-Tracking System (Public & Private)
<li>Discussion Forums (Public & Private)
<li>Press Releases
<li>Package Server/Build Server (tarballs, RPMs, DEBs)
<li>Subdomain hosting -- i.e., yourproject.sourceforge.org
<li>There are no hard quotas. However, should your directory exceed 150 megabytes, we will check to
see if the space your using is well justified. This policy will change over time as more resources are
acquired and allocated for this project.
<li>Restricted Shell Access                         
</p>                           
           
<p>
<li>We will not require that you place any banner or even reference to SourceForge on your page. 
<li>account acceptance is at our discretion and is based on the following criteria: relevance (Open
Source sofware projects only), legitimacy (your project must have a specific goal), and
appropriateness (no adult or otherwise publicly inacceptable material). Furthermore, SourceForge
reserves the right to revoke an existing account without notice if there is due cause. 
</p>

<p>    
We realize we may be presenting a few technical restrictions. However, if this project receives sufficient
interest from the community, we will obtain more computers for the project.
