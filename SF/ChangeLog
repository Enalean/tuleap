CODEX 1.6 (tag: CX_1_6) - 2003-07-08 - 6:00am EST

2003-07-07 18:52  ljulliar

	* utils/generate_doc.sh: Some more strengthening of the user guide
	commands to make them as directory independent as possible and also
	changed the mkdir statement in the generate_doc.sh script

2003-07-07 14:33  ljulliar

	* www/project/showfiles.php: Insert a few instructions at the top
	of the file release page.  (see patch #20)

2003-07-04 14:47  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: Commit #524 still doesn't fix the
	performance problem. The problem was coming from the
	commits_data_get_technicians function. The SQL query in there had 2
	unused table in the FROM statement causing the query to last for
	several seconds.

2003-07-04 11:46  jacquin

	* www/cvs/: browse_commit.php, commit_utils.php, detail_commit.php:
	performance issue at browse time.  Only consider commits, no more
	potential imported checkins grouped by dates.
	
	The import feature will then have to rebuild the commit session
	from repository logs.

2003-07-04 08:33  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/admin_commit.php: Fixed badly formed SELECT for CVS
	tracking menu causing some browser to fail displaying the on/off
	choice properly (see bug #24115)

2003-07-02 09:11  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/cvs_intro.php: Remove a spurious '}' (PHP3 ignores it but
	PHP4 generate a syntax error)

2003-06-24 17:42  ljulliar

	* www/support/support_utils.php: The support_header_admin function
	was checking that the project uses the bug tracker rather than the
	support manager!! (see bug #23721)

2003-06-23 11:19  ljulliar

	* www/: account/register.php, register/confirmation.php: User and
	project registration now generates an email notification to the
	site admin email address. It is no longer necessary for site
	administrators to visit the pending projects and pending users link
	on a regular basis.
	
	The messages displayed on the web page to confirm user registration
	has also been moved into a separate content file (Task #2886)

2003-06-23 10:35  ljulliar

	* www/include/utils.php: util_get_content accepts a second argument
	which is an array of named arguments needed by the included content
	file. Because the include is called from within the
	util_get_content function it doesn't see the variables of the
	calling scripts.

2003-06-20 17:45  ljulliar

	* db/upgrades/: db0011.sql, db0012.sql: Wrongly override the
	db0011.sql file. Restore it to previous version and commit
	db0012.sql. Relates to commit #396 and sr #102165)
	
	Note: Administrators please apply db0012.sql and not db0011.sql !!!

2003-06-20 17:40  ljulliar

	* db/: mysql/database_initvalues.sql, upgrades/db0011.sql: Insert a
	new file type in the frs_filetype table for files that are binary
	installers (installAnyware, InstallShield, etc. ) See SR #102165
	
	Note: Administrators of CodeX sites must run the db0011.sql file
	through the mysql shell to update the database.

2003-06-20 17:25  ljulliar

	* www/support/: index.php, support_data.php: Project members with
	'Tech Only' permission (S1) now has the ability to add a comment
	and also update the fields of the SR. (see SR #102181)

2003-06-20 15:42  ljulliar

	* www/search/index.php: Full text search on support requests now
	take into account the SR initial description and follw-up comments
	into account (See SR #102243)

2003-06-18 19:17  ljulliar

	* etc/httpd.conf.dist: Apache icons are now in /var/www/icons no
	longer in /home/httpd/icons. The template was changed accordingly.
	The PHP 3 RPMs were also rebuilt to install the php icons in
	/var/www/icons as well. They are available at the usual place
	
	All CodeX administrators should update their httpd.conf file and
	change /home/httpd/icons with /var/www/icons and ulso pdate their
	PHP packages. Then restart Apache.

2003-06-18 14:29  ljulliar

	* etc/cvsweb.conf.dist: cvsweb.cgi configuration file added as a
	template in SF/etc. Installation Guide update to explain how this
	configuration must be installed.

2003-06-18 14:22  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/cvs_intro.php: Typo corrected in the URL pointing to the
	CVS Tree (missing /). Thanks to Eddy Pounce for the fix.

2003-06-16 10:07  jacquin

	* db/mysql/: database_initvalues.sql, database_structure.sql:
	follow-up of task #2477. Structure declaration was wrong. (missing
	,) also provided non default tracking values to default initial
	projects.   Admin, none and news project don't need to be tracked.

2003-05-28 09:14  jacquin

	* utils/cvs1/log_accum: add of directory was not correctly tracked
	follow-up of task #2477

2003-05-23 11:49  ljulliar

	* utils/cvs1/log_accum: Minor type correction.

2003-05-23 11:39  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/commits_admin.php: File 'commits_admin' is not used.
	Deleted. The admin_commit.php script does the job (task #2477)

2003-05-23 11:38  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/: detail_commit.php, index.php: Code cleanup in the error
	messages (task #2477)

2003-05-23 11:23  ljulliar

	* utils/cvs1/log_accum, www/include/utils.php: 'commit #XXXX'
	patterns are now recognized both in the CVS log message and on the
	Web interface. They are automagically linked to the commit details
	in the CVS tracking database. (task #2477)

2003-05-23 10:00  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/cvs_intro.php: Get the group properties directly from the
	database. The cvs/intro text needs it. (fix commit #55) (Relates to
	task #2477)

2003-05-23 09:18  ljulliar

	* www/cvs/: admin_commit.php, browse_commit.php, commit_utils.php,
	cvs_intro.php, detail_commit.php, index.php: Code clean up of the
	commits_header function and move commits_header and commits_footer
	calls in each script to make it compliant with the rest of the
	CodeX source code. This also allows context specific help for each
	script.
	
	Reintroduced the CVS history commit/add counts in the cvs intro
	page that was deleted. Also made the intro page a distinct script
	(cvs_intro.php)
	
	CVS Admin script access restricted to project administrators
	
	Reintroduced the sanity check on the group_id parameter at
	beginning of each script where group_id is needed.
	
	(Follow-up of task #2477)

2003-05-21 19:32  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: 
	commiters list. back track to the pure list of members of the
	project.
	
	Too slow performance on joining the two ways at mysql level. Will
	probably split in two queries and join the results at php level.

2003-05-21 19:27  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: 
	commiters list generation. An unused sql query removed.

2003-05-21 19:22  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: Change the commiters list in the browse
	interface.
	
	 Cumulating the users of the project and the users who add commited
	in the project was wrongly done.
	
	 It cumulated the users of the project and the ones who commited in
	any project.
	
	 SQL query (select) change only.

2003-05-21 15:24  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: Help pointer generation

2003-05-21 15:09  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: the detail commit log message did not
	util_make_links

2003-05-21 14:24  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: only update cvs_tracking hooks when project
	is active

2003-05-21 11:15  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: typo in commit info for command call to
	prep_commit

2003-05-21 10:28  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: Enter the commit_prep command in the
	commitinfo file within a WAITED BLOCK if cvs_tracker is on, as done
	in commitinfo, and no more at creation time.

2003-05-20 14:36  jacquin

	* www/cvs/commit_utils.php: wrap the log message in the
	detail_commit presentation. Simple call to util_wrap_line, else
	<pre> formatting is still there.

2003-05-20 11:40  jacquin

	* utils/: include.pl, new_parse.pl: add-on to task #2477 commit :
	the new_parse project needs to upload local config to set the -U
	parameter in the log_accum command. To do that, db_connect has been
	splitted and load_local_config may get env without connecting to
	the database

2003-05-20 10:57  jacquin

	* utils/cvs1/log_accum: After, deployment of code for Task #2477,
	some updates: 1: Take into account the ./ directory within a
	module. 2- Initiate the loginfo file of tracked project with -C and
	-U flags in log_accum command.

2003-05-20 09:02  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: comment for cvs_tracker code

2003-05-20 08:25  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: The usage of log_accum inserted in comment
	block was incomplete.  Added the -nodb option, mainly for cvs
	backend test purpose

2003-05-20 08:17  jacquin

	* utils/new_parse.pl: This is the first commit tracked on codex
	server!!! A test one,
	
	 The default call to log_accum has to genereate cvsweb urls when
	cvs_tracker is on.

2003-05-20 07:44  jacquin

	* db/mysql/database_structure.sql, db/upgrades/db0011.sql,
	utils/group.pl, utils/new_parse.pl, utils/cvs1/checkins.pl,
	utils/cvs1/log_accum, utils/underworld-dummy/dump_database.pl,
	www/cvs/admin_commit.php, www/cvs/browse_commit.php,
	www/cvs/commit_utils.php, www/cvs/commits_admin.php,
	www/cvs/detail_commit.php, www/cvs/index.php: This commit for cvs
	backend feature. ( see Task #2477 )
	
	Apply db/upgrade/db0011.sql to patch this new feature on an
	existing database.
	
	The principle of this feature is to pilot from log_accum.pl the
	tracking and notification of commits by commit sessions. Small
	modification of log_accum to register commits and send
	notifications after verification in the database of the admin
	settings of projects.

2003-05-15 19:02  ljulliar

	* db/: mysql/database_structure.sql, upgrades/db0010.sql: Changes
	the default value of the status field from 100 (None) to 1 (open). 
	This was reported in bug #22071 but is a consequence of the fix in
	bug #21977).

2003-05-15 09:51  ljulliar

	* www/: bugs/bug_utils.php, patch/patch_utils.php, pm/pm_utils.php,
	support/support_utils.php: Email notification for all artifacts
	(bug, task, support request and patch) now include email headers to
	help people sort incoming emails.    X-CodeX-Project: project unix
	name (short name)    X-CodeX-Artifact: the type of artifact
	(bug|task|support|patch)    X-CodeX-Artifact-ID: Unique artifact ID
	 This was intially requested by Savannah but also by CodeX Users
	(task #2753)

2003-05-14 18:30  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/bug_data.php: Bug status_id field is no longer a special
	field so remove it from the list of fixed fields in the INSERT
	statement of a new bug. (bug #21977)

2003-05-13 19:06  jmayer

	* www/search/index.php: Bug #21225: Text search of bugs do not
	search the comments I added comment searching code, and the
	performance does not seem to be a problem.  The other search
	routines should be extended as well, but I'll split that off as
	another task.

2003-05-06 10:17  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/: bug_utils.php, detail_bug.php, index.php, mod_bug.php:
	It is now possible to obtain a printer-friendly version of a bug
	update form. 'Printer Version' icon added to the upper right corner
	of the form.  (See bug#18194)

2003-04-30 08:28  ljulliar

	* db/mysql/database_initvalues.sql,
	db/mysql/database_structure.sql, db/upgrades/db0009.sql,
	www/bugs/add_bug.php, www/bugs/detail_bug.php,
	www/bugs/admin/other_settings.php: The 'Other Configuration
	Settings' script of the bug tracking system now allows the project
	administrator to deny the right of submitting/updating a bug to
	users who are not logged in. Documentation updated accordingly. 
	**NOTE** This change also requires to apply a database patch
	(db0009.sql) (See Task #1911)

2003-04-16 16:36  ljulliar

	* www/include/utils.php: Empty date fields were not checked in the
	function in charge of transforming the date string into Unix Epoch
	time  causing empty date fields to subsequently show-up as
	1970-01-1 in the bug form (SR #101843)

2003-04-16 16:06  ljulliar

	* www/project/export/bug_export.php: Previous commit was wrong. All
	select box fields are actually exported as text information  in the
	snapshot database because we use their textual representation not
	their ID value.  (bug #20670)

2003-04-15 19:34  ljulliar

	* www/project/export/: bug_export.php, project_export_utils.php:
	Bug field types were not correctly tested in the export facilty
	(bug_export script) leading to an erroneous type cast on
	varchar(255). They are now TEXT as they should. As a side effect I
	have generalized the prepare_bug_record function in
	project_export_utils.php to handle all date fields properly.  (See
	bug #20670)

2003-04-14 11:42  sbouhet

	* www/pm/admin/index.php: Comment the access of Fields usage and
	values : not yet implemented Related bug #20771

2003-04-14 10:58  jacquin

	* www/project/download.php: use real basename in header (nneeded
	for askOnce wrappers in partners

2003-04-14 10:08  sbouhet

	* db/mysql/database_initvalues.sql: Add the project_type value for
	the inserts for the groups table.  Related bug #20250

2003-04-11 21:19  jmayer

	* www/project/admin/userperms.php: The "Yes" to the right of the
	radio button in the "Project Admin" column often wraps to below the
	radio button.  I replaced the space with a non-breaking space.

2003-04-11 21:01  jmayer

	* www/bugs/admin/bug_admin_utils.php: The check for a field being
	in "project scope" was only successfully done in one of the two
	places it needed to be checked.  Fixed.

2003-04-11 20:37  jmayer

	* www/bugs/admin/field_values.php: There are a couple of problems
	in the forms in "bugs/admin/field_values.php". In particular, the
	closing bracket for the creation form occurs BEFORE the description
	field, and the closing bracket for the update form is missing.

2003-04-04 22:48  jmayer

	* www/include/: cache.php, utils.php: Modified include/cache.php so
	that it generates HTTP references to localhost using the correct
	port.  The logic for this was put in the function "make_local_url"
	in include/utils.php.  See bug #20508 for details.

2003-04-02 22:46  jmayer

	* www/bugs/bug_utils.php: Changed the formatting of the bug
	properties to put long items on lines by themselves.  See SR
	#101788 for details.

2003-04-02 17:27  ljulliar

	* www/: bugs/browse_bug.php, include/utils.php: When the '='
	operator was used in a date field, the end time of the day was not
	computed properly causing the '=' operator to fail. A new function
	has been added in util to explode an YYYY-MM-DD date into its
	parts.	(Fixes bug #20439)

2003-04-02 16:08  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/add_bug.php: Whether a bug field is made visible on the
	bug submission form depends on the fact that the iser is a project
	member or not. The permission check was wrongly asking for the user
	to be a project member with Bug Admin permission. (Fixes bug
	#20433)

2003-04-02 10:14  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/bug_data.php: Forgot to remove the SQL query debugging
	flag when I fixed SR #101767. This correction fixes bug #20407.

2003-04-01 17:38  ljulliar

	* www/include/project_home.php: In case 2 releases are published
	the same day, the current sort algorithm on release_date does not
	help. Rather than introducing a new release time field I have taken
	the option to add a secondary sort criteria on the release_id which
	should in most cases show the newest release first.  (Fix bug
	#20369)

2003-04-01 13:52  ljulliar

	* www/project/showfiles.php: In case 2 releases are published the
	same day, the current sort algorithm on release_date does not help.
	Rather than introducing a new release time field I have taken the
	option to add secondary sort criteria on the release id which
	should in most cases show the newest release first.  (Fix bug
	#20369)

2003-04-01 11:51  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/bug_data.php: There was a bug in the function in charge
	of inserting the new bug in the database. A date field with a non
	empty value was converted properly converted to internal time
	format. (fixes SR #101767 - Thanks to Dana Besaw)

2003-04-01 10:09  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/bug_data.php: Forgot to modify permission check in th
	bug_data_handle_update function when I fixed SR #101721. This
	problem was reported in SR #101769.

2003-03-31 15:25  ljulliar

	* utils/download/: README, stats_agr_filerelease.pl,
	stats_logparse.sh, stats_nightly_filerelease.pl: On CodeX, all file
	downloads are now tracked directly at the PHP level and an audit
	trail goes in the filedownload_log table.  The scripts in charge of
	the download statistics have been modified to reflect this (old!)
	change. This will also have a positive impact on the
	www/showfiles.php D/L figures that should now be correct.  The
	README file has also been updated.  (SR #101727)

2003-03-31 10:19  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/index.php: Bug technicians are allowed to modify bugs.
	Only the admin part is restricted (see SR #101721)

2003-03-28 17:29  sbouhet

	* db/mysql/database_structure.sql: Add the project_type in the
	groups declaration. Forgotten by the task #2259

2003-03-25 19:16  jmayer

	* www/: bugs/bug_utils.php, pm/pm_utils.php,
	support/support_utils.php: For bug #19712.  There's a bug/feature
	in Outlook 2002/2003 that messes up the formatting of messages from
	the CodeX bug tracker. Recent versions of Outlook attempt to
	automagically unwrap text in text/plain messages. In some cases,
	such as the "Additional Follow-up Comments" line in bug tracker
	emails, outlook wraps messages from CodeX inappropriately.
	
	Here's a Microsoft support message documenting the problem and some
	work arounds:
	
	    http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=287816
	
	The listed routines were modified so that seperator lines are not
	perceived as flowable text by Outlook 2002.  This mostly consists
	of adding sequences of three spaces when there is embedded text in
	the seperator line.

2003-03-25 16:54  jmayer

	* www/account/login.php: Modified login.php in response to bug
	#18923.  The changes result in the system staying in SSL mode under
	the following circumstances:
	
	(1) the session is secure (2) the sys_https_host global is not
	empty (3) either (a) the sys_force_ssl global is set (b) the
	sys_stay_in_ssl global is NOT set (c) the stay_in_ssl POST variable
	is set
	
	Note that the name of the sys_stay_in_ssl global is confusing. If
	this is 1, then the user will be presented with a choice... a
	better name would be "sys_stay_in_ssl_dialog"!

2003-03-25 10:38  ljulliar

	* www/account/login.php: Wrongly committed changes while fixing SR
	#101726. Reverting to revision 1.64

2003-03-25 10:26  ljulliar

	* www/: account/login.php, bugs/add_bug.php, bugs/bug_utils.php,
	bugs/mod_bug.php, pm/add_task.php, pm/mod_task.php,
	pm/pm_utils.php: Increase upper limit for file attachements in the
	bug tracker and task manager to 2 Mbytes. There was actually a bug
	in the task manager where the limit was 20 Mbytes. This has been
	changed. Also advise users to compress their files. (SR #101726)

2003-03-20 22:52  ljulliar

	* www/: bugs/bug_utils.php, pm/pm_utils.php,
	support/support_utils.php: There was a number of calls to the
	util_unconvert_htmlspecialchars function in the generation of the
	email notification causing some text fields to contain HTML
	entities (e.g. &quot;) instead of the equivalent ASCII character
	(Bug #19993)

2003-03-20 22:25  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/: bug_utils.php, admin/field_usage.php: Relax the
	condition under which the presence of a field on the bug submission
	form can be configured. Required fields (fields which must be used
	in the bug tracking system) can now be made (in)visible on the bugr
	submission form. Plus a nasty bug was corrected ($field_name was
	used instead of $field)
	
	It also means that these fields can initially have an empty value
	even if they are not allowed to have it. This is not much of a
	problem since when the bug is going to be modified the next time,
	the project member will be warned about these empty values and will
	have to fill them in. Of course if the fields in question shows up
	on the submission form the check on the empty value will be done.
	
	See SR #101705, SR #101707

2003-03-20 20:39  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/: add_bug.php, index.php: CC field now showing on the
	bug submission form as requested by bug #19621

2003-03-17 19:21  jmayer

	* www/include/pre.php: Added "lostlogin.php" to the list of files
	in "pre.php" that can be accessed without a valid login.  See bug
	#19675 for details.

2003-03-05 15:49  jmayer

	* utils/underworld-dummy/mail_aliases.pl: Modified so that the
	output uses local names, not fully qualified names, on the left
	side of the generated /dumps/aliases file.  This does not appear to
	break anything (alias processing seems to take place after
	stripping domain names anyway), but name conflicts may be an issue
	in the future.	This is an emergency patch, in response to bug
	#19224.

2003-02-28 19:36  ljulliar

	* www/bugs/mod_bug.php: Submit button added next to the followup
	comment field for those projects using a lot of header fields
	making it tedious to scroll the window to reach either the upper or
	lower SUBMIT button (request from SDI project)

2003-02-26 17:32  ljulliar

	* www/snippet/detail.php: The id used in the snippet download URL
	must be the id of the snippet version not the id of the snippet
	itself (bug #18782)

2003-02-26 16:58  sbouhet

	* www/admin/groupedit.php: Task #2255: Display the project type

	(Can't log on) and bug #17359 (Brows CVS link does not include
	configured port numbers).
	
	They make the following changes:
	
	(1) CVS URLs are generated from "sys_default_domain" instead of
	"sys_cvs_host".
	
	(2) CVS URLs to repositories now end in "/", this avoids an
	unnecessary redirection.
	
	(3) In the "cvsweb" stuff, redirections to the CodeX login page no
	longer specify the protocol to use.  This is in line with the way
	such redirections are handled from PHP.
	
	(4) A bug in "pre.php" is fixed that caused redirections to break
	if the protocol was explicitly provided (this was the direct cause
	of the problem in support request #101520).
	
	(5) Comments were added to local.inc.dist to clarify that the
	cvsweb interface always runs on the "sys_default_domain" web
	server, and that if the "sys_cvs_host" machine is different, then
	the "sys_default_domain" host must be able to remotely mount the
	cvs host's file system.

	and memory_limit to 30 Mo.  Add hidden input MAX_FILE_SIZE to all

SOURCEFORGE 2.0   
	- To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge, 
	  visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at 
	  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Foundry code now present and cleaned up.
	  You can create new foundries simply by selecting that option in 
	  the /admin/groupedit.php page (Tim)

	- Theming support sitewide and html library cleanup. Sample themes 
	  included in /www/themes/ (Geoff)

	- Audit trail for projects. Now when site-admins and project-admins 
	  change a project, certain events will cause an audit trail recording 
	  (events like adding/removing users, updating permissions, etc) (Tim)

	- File release system totally rewritten from the ground up to use a 
	  more normalized database schema. There is an upgrade script in 
	  /www/admin/ which should help you migrate data from the old 
	  structure (Tim)

	- Using some classes to "objectize" things like Groups, Projects, 
	  and Foundries. Project and Foundry extend Group. See 
	  /include/Group.class /include/Foundry.class and 
	  /include/Project.class (Tim)

	- Hundreds of misc. interface cleanups sitewide. More user feedback, 
	  ordering of pop-up list boxes, submit buttons added to the tops of 
	  many forms sitewide, etc etc (Tim, Geoff, Wallace Lee)

	- Task manager can now move tasks among subprojects. (Wallace Lee)

	- Sitewide stats project. Organizing daily stats for each project 
	  into summary tables, graphing the results. (Matt Snelham)

	- Groundwork for advogato-like system of peer ratings. Need to 
	  finish user interface. New system goes beyond advogato, as each 
	  user has a unique "importance factor" and overall ranking among 
	  all users on the entire site. Only users that have achieved a 
	  "trust" level will be able to successfully rate others. See 
	  /www/admin/calculate_user_metric.php (Tim)

	- Changed user home pages to /users/*user_name*/ using .htaccess 
	  directive similar to /foundry/ and /project/ (Tim)

SOURCEFORGE 1.5.0 

        - To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge,           
          visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at
          http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Added a "portability" patch. Massive thanks to 
	  William Hardeman and David HM Spector for this. SF deployers 
	  everywhere will thank them

	- Removed a lot of hard-coded references to SF.net everywhere, 
	  including hard-coded user_id's of the SF core staff

	- Wallace Lee continues to make numerous clean patches throughout 
	  the site (naming forums/subprojects/mailing lists among others)

	- Optimizations throughout the code base - added intelligence to the
	  user.php and group.php library so database queries aren't wasted. 

	- Tested under PHP4 and only one know issue was found and fixed.

	- Starting the process of database portability. Changed the keyword 
	  "public" in groups to "is_public". Changing the "user" table to 
	  "users" is next in line, but it is a HUGE task.

	- Tested some features on Postgres and found that LIMIT/OFFSET 
	  syntax is incompatible. Postgres also cannot yet handle large 
	  text fields that are > 8K in length (problem for the patch Mgr)

	- Slick new "browse" options on the bug/task/support/project mgrs

	- Changed project homepages to "/projects/*project_name*/" using 
	  the .htaccess "files" directive. This is known to be problematic 
	  on some other platforms.

	- Laid groundwork for "portals" which are half-baked and considered 
	  useless right now.

	- Project Admin page modernized
