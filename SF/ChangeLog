2.0   
	- To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge, 
	  visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at 
	  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Foundry code now present and cleaned up.
	  You can create new foundries simply by selecting that option in 
	  the /admin/groupedit.php page (Tim)

	- Theming support sitewide and html library cleanup. Sample themes 
	  included in /www/themes/ (Geoff)

	- Audit trail for projects. Now when site-admins and project-admins 
	  change a project, certain events will cause an audit trail recording 
	  (events like adding/removing users, updating permissions, etc) (Tim)

	- File release system totally rewritten from the ground up to use a 
	  more normalized database schema. There is an upgrade script in 
	  /www/admin/ which should help you migrate data from the old 
	  structure (Tim)

	- Using some classes to "objectize" things like Groups, Projects, 
	  and Foundries. Project and Foundry extend Group. See 
	  /include/Group.class /include/Foundry.class and 
	  /include/Project.class (Tim)

	- Hundreds of misc. interface cleanups sitewide. More user feedback, 
	  ordering of pop-up list boxes, submit buttons added to the tops of 
	  many forms sitewide, etc etc (Tim, Geoff, Wallace Lee)

	- Task manager can now move tasks among subprojects. (Wallace Lee)

	- Sitewide stats project. Organizing daily stats for each project 
	  into summary tables, graphing the results. (Matt Snelham)

	- Groundwork for advogato-like system of peer ratings. Need to 
	  finish user interface. New system goes beyond advogato, as each 
	  user has a unique "importance factor" and overall ranking among 
	  all users on the entire site. Only users that have achieved a 
	  "trust" level will be able to successfully rate others. See 
	  /www/admin/calculate_user_metric.php (Tim)

	- Changed user home pages to /users/*user_name*/ using .htaccess 
	  directive similar to /foundry/ and /project/ (Tim)

1.5.0 

        - To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge,           
          visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at
          http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Added a "portability" patch. Massive thanks to 
	  William Hardeman and David HM Spector for this. SF deployers 
	  everywhere will thank them

	- Removed a lot of hard-coded references to SF.net everywhere, 
	  including hard-coded user_id's of the SF core staff

	- Wallace Lee continues to make numerous clean patches throughout 
	  the site (naming forums/subprojects/mailing lists among others)

	- Optimizations throughout the code base - added intelligence to the
	  user.php and group.php library so database queries aren't wasted. 

	- Tested under PHP4 and only one know issue was found and fixed.

	- Starting the process of database portability. Changed the keyword 
	  "public" in groups to "is_public". Changing the "user" table to 
	  "users" is next in line, but it is a HUGE task.

	- Tested some features on Postgres and found that LIMIT/OFFSET 
	  syntax is incompatible. Postgres also cannot yet handle large 
	  text fields that are > 8K in length (problem for the patch Mgr)

	- Slick new "browse" options on the bug/task/support/project mgrs

	- Changed project homepages to "/projects/*project_name*/" using 
	  the .htaccess "files" directive. This is known to be problematic 
	  on some other platforms.

	- Laid groundwork for "portals" which are half-baked and considered 
	  useless right now.

	- Project Admin page modernized
