/**
 * This class represents a virtual TopMilestone
 *
 * In essence, it is a milestone that sits above all other milestones in a
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * Example 1: Say your only milestones are called sprints. Then collections
 * of sprints will not be defined. So, this virtual top milestone will represent the
 * collection of all sprints.
 *
 * Example 2: Say you have milestones called releases and each release has a set
 * of sprints. In this case, collections/ sets of releases will not be defined.
 * Thus, this virtual milestone will represent the set of all releases.
 *
 * Because of all this, a Planning_VirtualTopMilestone does not correspond to any
 * Tracker_Artifact; there is no artifact that represents this milestone or
 * vice-versa. Hence, most of the properties of a virtual milestone are irrelevant
 * and null
 *
