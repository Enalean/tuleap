Solr example configuration
--------------------------

To run this example configuration, use 

  java -jar start.jar

in this directory, and when Solr is started connect to 

  http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/

To add documents to the index, use the post.sh script in the exampledocs
subdirectory (while Solr is running), for example:

  cd exampledocs
  ./post.sh *.xml

See also README.txt in the solr subdirectory, and check
http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrResources for a list of tutorials and
introductory articles.

NOTE: This Solr example server references SolrCell jars outside of the server
directory with <lib> statements in the solrconfig.xml.  If you make a copy of
this example server and wish to use the ExtractingRequestHandler (SolrCell),
you will need to copy the required jars into solr/lib or update the paths to
the jars in your solrconfig.xml.
