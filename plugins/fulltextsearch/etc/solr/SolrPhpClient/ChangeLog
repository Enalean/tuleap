	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Fixes #20 - in previous fix, used
	  stream_context_set_params when I should have used
	  stream_context_set_option

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Fixes #20 - Reusing a get and post
	  context for each request instead of creating a new stream context
	  for each. PHP does not provide a function to delete created
	  stream contexts and does not appear to clean them up when they go
	  out of scope, which leads to high memory usage when many solr
	  requests were issued (typically in indexing usage)

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Fixes #21 - Adding method to delete by
	  multiple IDs. Thanks to pwolanin

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php: The split function is deprecated as of
	  PHP 5.3. Furthermore, since none of my split's were using a regex
	  it is better to use explode anyway. Fixes #19

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php: Removed todo's
	  about investigating Serialized PHP and PHP output writer usage.
	  I've made the decision to stick to usage of JSON output writer
	  until it can be proven that the other output writers are more
	  stable or provide a substantially faster implementation. Closes
	  issue #6

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Adding
	  useful SVN metadata constants to each Apache_Solr class by svn
	  keyword substitution. Fixes issue #16

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Fixes issue #5 - Applying patch (with
	  minor changes) from mkalkbrenner to replace all control
	  characters in Apache_Solr_Document keys / values with spaces to
	  avoid an exception from Solr's XML Parser.

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: See issue #14
	  * adding timeout parameters to all delete functions

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: See issue #8
	  * Adding the ability to specify the HTTP method used for sending
	  a search query (GET or POST)

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: See
	  http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/issues/detail?id=4
	  * Reworking Service::ping() to just use file_get_contents URL
	  wrappers like we do for other GET's and POST operations
	  * Reworked Service::_sendRawGet() and Service::_sendRawPost() to
	  create a new stream context each time. Used for controlled
	  request timeouts, headers, and POST information

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php: See
	  http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/issues/detail?id=2
	  
	  Attempting to fix null vs. false boost parameter value issue by
	  always casting to float value first.
	  
	  Needs tested.

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: See
	  http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/issues/detail?id=1
	  
	  Changed require_once statements that expected the Solr Client
	  library to be on the include path into statements that use the
	  __FILE__ magic constant to do them as absolute paths. This should
	  get rid of the requirement for the user to change their include
	  path configuration or add the library to the include path at
	  runtime.
	  
	  Provided as a convenience for the user.
