Elastic Search
==============

This plugin is still in heavy development: do not use in production!


Development setup
-----------------

Install elasticsearch:

    $ cd /opt
    $ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.19.0.tar.gz
    $ tar zxf elasticsearch-0.19.0.tar.gz
    $ cd elasticsearch-0.19.0

Install the elasticsearch attachments plugin:

    $ ./bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/1.2.0

Start the elasticsearch server:

    $ ./bin/elasticsearch

The elasticsearch PHP client should have been installed during installation of
this plugin. See http://github.com/nervetattoo/elasticsearch for details.

Create the index:

    $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:9200/tuleap/

Define the attachment mapping:

    $ curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/tuleap/docman/_mapping" -d \
        '{"docman": {"properties": {"file": {"type": "attachment"}}}}'

Check it worked:

    $ curl "localhost:9200/tuleap/docman/_mapping"

Now upload a file into the docman. Then, for some text (e.g. Foo) in the
uploaded file:

    $ curl 'localhost:9200/tuleap/docman/_search?q=Foo'
