; oai.ini -- OAI-PMH harvest settings.
;
; For every OAI-PMH source you would like to harvest, create a section like this:
;
; [section_name]
; url = http://oai.myuniversity.edu/
; set = my_optional_set
; metadataPrefix = oai_dc
; idPrefix = "oai:myuniversity.edu:"
; dateGranularity = auto
;
; The section_name may be passed to harvest_oai.php as a parameter to harvest only
; records from that source.  This is also the directory name that records will be
; harvested into (a subdirectory of "harvest" under VUFIND_HOME).
;
; url is the base URL for the OAI-PMH source.
;
; set is the name of a set to harvest (leave it out to harvest all records).
;
; metadataPrefix is the metadata format to harvest (oai_dc will be used by default
; if the value is omitted).
;
; idPrefix is the OAI-specific prefix attached to ID values.  If you provide the
; value here, it will be automatically stripped for you when generating filenames
; and tracking deleted records.  If you omit the setting, full OAI ids will be
; retained.
;
; dateGranularity is the granularity used by the server for representing dates.
; This may be "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ," "YYYY-MM-DD" or "auto" (to query the server
; for details).  The default is "auto."
