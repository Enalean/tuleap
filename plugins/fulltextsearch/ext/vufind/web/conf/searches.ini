; below.

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of most pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with a
; search handler (either DisMax or from conf/searchspecs.yaml).  The value of
; each setting is the text to display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run
; through the translator, so be sure to update language files if necessary.  The
; order of these settings will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
;
; Note: The search type of "tag" is a special case that gets handled differently
;       because tags are not stored in the same index as everything else.  Treat
;       this as a reserved word if you create your own custom search handlers.

; This section defines the sort options available on standard search results.
; Values on the left of the equal sign are either the reserved term "relevance"
; or the name of a Solr index to use for sorting; asc and desc modifiers may be 
; used in combination with index names, but not relevance.  To allow secondary
; sorting, you may include a comma-separated list of options (for example,
; "year desc,title asc"), but this list may NOT include the special "relevance"
; value.  Values on the right of the equal sign are text that will be run 
; through the translation module and displayed on screen.
;
; Note: "year", "author" and "title" are special shortcut aliases for the
;       "publishDate", "authorStr" and "title_sort" Solr fields; you can use 
;       either form in this file.

; Use the "callnumber" line for LC or the "dewey-sort" line for Dewey Decimal.
; If you want to enable both systems for sorting, you can uncomment both lines,
; but you will need to add some custom text to distinguish between the two.

; This section allows you to specify the default sort order for specific types of
; searches.  Each key in this section should correspond with a key in the
; [Basic_Searches] section above.  Each value should correspond with a key in the
; [Sorting] section above.  Any search type that is not listed here will be sorted
; using the default_sort setting in the [General] section above.
[DefaultSortingByType]

; Each search type defined in searchspecs.yaml can have one or more "recommendations
; modules" associated with it in the following sections.  These plug-ins will cause
; boxes of suggestions to appear beside (in [SideRecommendations]) or above (in
; [TopRecommendations]) the search results.  You can repeat the line to display a
; series of recommendations boxes in a particular section -- just be sure to include
; brackets ("[]") after the search type name.  If you do not want recommendations
; for a particular search type, set the value to "false" in either or both sections.
; Any search types not listed here will use the default value -- see the
; default_top_recommend and default_side_recommend settings in the [General]
; section above.  It is legal to set the default options to false if you want no
; default value.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the side area:
;
; CatalogResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display catalog search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This is designed for use with non-catalog modules.
; ExpandFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."  Rather than using 
;       facets to limit the existing search, this module uses them to start a new
;       search showing all records matching the selected facet value.
; SideFacets:[regular facet section]:[checkbox facet section]:[ini name]
;       Display the specified facets, where [ini name] is the name of an ini file
;       in web/conf (defaults to "facets" if not supplied), [regular facet section]
;       is the name of a section of the ini file containing standard facet settings
;       (defaults to "Results" if not specified), and [checkbox facet section] is 
;       the name of a section of the ini file containing checkbox facet settings 
;       (leave blank for no checkbox facets).
; SummonDatabases:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated database recommendations matching the terms found 
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display Summon search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the top area:
;
; AuthorFacets
;       Display author names based on the search term.
; TopFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."
; WorldCatIdentities
;       Use the WorldCat Identities API to find names and related subjects based
;       on the current search.
; WorldCatTerms
;       Use the WorldCat Terminologies API to find Library of Congress Subject 
;       Headings related to the current search.
;
; You can build your own recommendations modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       http://vufind.org/wiki/building_a_recommendations_module

; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.

; This section controls the "New Items" search.
[NewItem]
; Comma-separated list of date ranges to offer to the user (i.e. 1,5,30 = one day
; old, or five days old, or thirty days old).  Be careful about raising the maximum
; age too high -- searching very long date ranges may put a load on your ILS.
ranges = 1,5,30
; This setting controls the maximum number of pages of results that will show up
; when doing a new item search.  It is necessary to limit the number of results to
; avoid getting a "too many boolean clauses" error from the Solr index (see notes
; at http://vufind.org/jira/browse/VUFIND-128 for more details).  However, if you 
; set the value too low, you may get the same results no matter which range setting 
; is selected!
result_pages = 10
; This setting can be used to automatically apply filter queries to the New Item
; results.  For example, you might want to filter out certain content types.  You
; can add multiple filters by repeating the "filter[] =" line, or you can skip 
; filtering entirely by leaving the line commented out.
; filter[] = "format:Book"
