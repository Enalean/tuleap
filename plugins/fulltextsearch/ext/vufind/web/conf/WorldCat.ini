; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of WorldCat pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with one
; or more indices defined in the WorldCat API (multiple values are separated by
; colons).  The value of each setting is the text to display on screen.  All 
; on-screen text will be run through the translator, so be sure to update language 
; files if necessary.  The order of these settings will be maintained in the 
; drop-down list in the UI.
