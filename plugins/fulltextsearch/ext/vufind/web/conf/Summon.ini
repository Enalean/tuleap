; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only 
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be 
; recognized regardless of case.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the
; top of the search results and all facets to the side.  You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.
default_top_recommend[] = SummonDatabases
;default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:FacetsTop:Summon
default_side_recommend[] = SideFacets:Facets:CheckboxFacets:Summon

; Summon has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.
; You can raise this value as high as 20000, but performance suffers as page 
; numbers increase.
result_limit = 2000

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; Summon as they do in the regular Search module.
[SideRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.
[TopRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.

; This section is reserved for special boolean facets.  These are displayed
; as checkboxes.  If the box is checked, the filter on the left side of the
; equal sign is applied.  If the box is not checked, the filter is not applied.
; The value on the right side of the equal sign is the text to display to the
; user.  It will be run through the translation code, so be sure to update the
; language files appropriately.
;
; NOTE: Do not create CheckboxFacets using values that also exist in the
;       [Facets] section below -- this will not work correctly.
[CheckboxFacets]
IsScholarly:true = scholarly_limit
IsFullText:true = fulltext_limit
holdingsOnly:false = add_other_libraries

; The order of display is as shown below
; The name of the index field is on the left
; The display name of the field is on the right
;
; The name of the index field may optionally be followed by comma-separated
; parameters (i.e. ",or,1,15") as defined by the Summon API.  Any provided 
; parameters will override defaults like the facet_limit setting in
; [Facet_Settings] below.

; These facets will be shown above search results if the TopFacets recommendations
; module is used, as opposed to the [Facets] section, which is shown to the side 
; of search results when the SideFacets module is used.
;
; NOTE: This section is not used by default -- see default_top_recommend setting
; above for more details.

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of Summon pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with an
; index defined in the Summon API.  The value of each setting is the text to 
; display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run through the translator, so 
; be sure to update language files if necessary.  The order of these settings 
; will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
;
; Note: The search type of "AllFields" is a special case that searches all
;       fields.  All remaining values are from the list documented here:
