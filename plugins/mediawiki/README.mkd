The plugin adds support for Mediawiki to Tuleap. When the plugin
is activated for a project, a Mediawiki instance for the project is
created, that can be edited by project members.

If you installed this plugin from the package management system (RPM) all
dependencies are already installed, you just need to activate the plugin
to start using it.

Current integration was tested with mediawiki 1.20.3.

Based on Fusionforge mediawiki plugin.
