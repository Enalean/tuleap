FUSIONFORGE MEDIAWIKI PLUGIN README
-----------------------------------
Olaf Lenz, 2010

The plugin adds support for Mediawiki to FusionForge. When the plugin
is activated for a project, a Mediawiki instance for the project is
created, that can be edited by project members.

This file describes how to INSTALL and CUSTOMIZE the plugin, and what
to do when the Mediawiki instalation is UPGRADEd.

Installation
------------

If you have installed FusionForge and the plugin via a packaging
system (RPM or DEB), the plugin should be ready to run and only needs
to be enabled in the plugin manager.
If you have manually installed FusionForge, you need to do the
following to get it working:

1. Download the Mediawiki sources from 
      http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki
   or install Mediawiki via a package manager.

2. Unpack the sources into a directory that is accessible to
   FusionForge.

3. Put the path to Mediawiki's source directory into the configuration
   variable "[mediawiki]source_path" by adding the following lines into
   your FusionForge configuration file (@CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini):

[mediawiki]
src_path = < Mediawiki source path >

4. Run

> php bin/mw-plugin-init.php

  This will create a number of symbolic links in the FusionForge var
  directory (/var/lib/fusionforge) required by the plugin. The command
  has to be run by a user that can write to the FusionForge var
  directory.

5. Adapt and add the contents of the file etc/httpd.d/61plugin-mediawiki to
   your apache configuration. To do that, the script "setup" might be
   helpful. Furthermore, adapt and add the following lines to the
   apache configuration:

RedirectMatch 301 ^({sys_urlprefix}plugins/mediawiki/wiki/[-a-zA-Z0-9_]*)/*$ $1/index.php
        AliasMatch ^{sys_urlprefix}plugins/mediawiki/wiki/[-a-zA-Z0-9_]*/api.php {usr_share_gforge}/www/plugins/mediawiki/api.php
        AliasMatch ^{sys_urlprefix}plugins/mediawiki/wiki/[-a-zA-Z0-9_]*/index.php {usr_share_gforge}/www/plugins/mediawiki/index.php
        AliasMatch ^{sys_urlprefix}plugins/mediawiki/wiki/([-a-zA-Z0-9_]*)/images/(.*) {var_lib_gforge}/plugins/mediawiki/projects/$1/images/$2
	AliasMatch ^{sys_urlprefix}plugins/mediawiki/wiki/([-a-zA-Z0-9_]*)/skins/(.*) /usr/share/gforge/www/plugins/mediawiki/skins/$2

6. Add the cronjob in etc/cron.d/mediawiki to the FusionForge
   crontab. To do that, the script "setup" might be helpful.

Customizing the plugin
----------------------

The Mediawiki plugin knows all configuration variables described in
etc/config.ini. To customize Mediawiki (e.g. enable uploads), change
the value of any of the variables in the file
@CONFIG_PATH@/config.ini.

Furthermore, you can customize all Mediawiki instances within
FusionForge by creating and/or modifying the file
  @CONFIG_PATH@/plugins/mediawiki/LocalSettings.php 
In this file, you can add extensions or change anything that can be
done in Mediawiki's LocalSettings.php.

To customize the settings of a specific project, you can additionally
create a file 
  @DATA_PATH@/plugin/mediawiki/projects/<project>/ProjectSettings.php
with additional customizations.


Upgrading the Mediawiki installation
------------------------------------

(TODO: not working!)
When FusionForge was installed from a package manager, this should be
happening automatically. Otherwise, when the Mediawiki installation is
upgraded, it is necessary to upgrade all project instances. To do
that, you can call

	bin/mw-wrapper <project> update.php
