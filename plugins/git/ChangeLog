Version 3.0 - Tuleap 5.13
    * story #2967 - Serialize gitolite events

    Sevral concurrent processes accessing the same gitolite admin repository
    in the same time seems to lead to race conditions and sometime might
    crash gitolite authorized_keys.

    Furthermore, as the number of git repositories grow, modifications made on
    gitolite admin repo takes time to push (compile time in gitolite to generate
    the permission schema).

    With this change, all gitolite admin operations (ssh keys modifications,
    creation of repository, deletion, update of description, update of permissions,
    update of mailing list details, move to gerrit, etc) are done one after
    another (serialized), in background (system event).

    For end user, it means a UI with better reactivity but a little bit of delay
    to actually get the things propagated at git/gitolite level (usually a couple
    of minutes).

Version 2.7.39 - Tuleap 5.13
    * story #1462: synchronize user ssh keys with gerrit servers

Version 2.7.38 - Tuleap 5.13
    story #2795 - tuleap binded groups to be replicated on Gerrit

    The Tuleap binded groups are replicated as Gerrit group of groups
    aka. included groups.
    This implies that, on gerrit side, we cannot take into account private
    projects or restricted users settings into account.

    Given a "Developers" user group in Tuleap "Top Level" public project
    And a "Developers" user group in Tuleap "Product" private project, bound to "Top Level/Developers"
    And "John", member of "Developers", "Top Level" project member but NOT "Product" project member
    Then John don't have access to any content in "Product" Tuleap project
    But he has access to Gerrit project that grant access to "Product/Developers" group

    While this scenario might sounds legit, the behaviours are differents and should probably be documented.
