#
# An example hook script to mail out commit update information.  This hook
# sends emails listing new revisions to the repository introduced by the
# change being reported.  The rule is that (for branch updates) each commit
# will appear on one email and one email only.
#
# This hook is stored in the contrib/hooks directory.  Your distribution
# will have put this somewhere standard.  You should make this script
# executable then link to it in the repository you would like to use it in.
# For example, on debian the hook is stored in
# /usr/share/doc/git-core/contrib/hooks/post-receive-email:
#
#  chmod a+x post-receive-email
#  cd /path/to/your/repository.git
#  ln -sf /usr/share/doc/git-core/contrib/hooks/post-receive-email hooks/post-receive
#
# This hook script assumes it is enabled on the central repository of a
# project, with all users pushing only to it and not between each other.  It
# will still work if you don't operate in that style, but it would become
# possible for the email to be from someone other than the person doing the
# push.
#
# To help with debugging and use on pre-v1.5.1 git servers, this script will
# also obey the interface of hooks/update, taking its arguments on the
# command line.  Unfortunately, hooks/update is called once for each ref.
# To avoid firing one email per ref, this script just prints its output to
# the screen when used in this mode.  The output can then be redirected if
# wanted.
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.mailinglist
#   This is the list that all pushes will go to; leave it blank to not send
#   emails for every ref update.
# hooks.announcelist
#   This is the list that all pushes of annotated tags will go to.  Leave it
#   blank to default to the mailinglist field.  The announce emails lists
#   the short log summary of the changes since the last annotated tag.
# hooks.envelopesender
#   If set then the -f option is passed to sendmail to allow the envelope
#   sender address to be set
# hooks.emailprefix
#   All emails have their subjects prefixed with this prefix, or "[SCM]"
#   if emailprefix is unset, to aid filtering
# hooks.showrev
#   The shell command used to format each revision in the email, with
#   "%s" replaced with the commit id.  Defaults to "git rev-list -1
#   --pretty %s", displaying the commit id, author, date and log
#   message.  To list full patches separated by a blank line, you
#   could set this to "git show -C %s; echo".
#   To list a gitweb/cgit URL *and* a full patch for each change set, use this:
#     "t=%s; printf 'http://.../?id=%%s' \$t; echo;echo; git show -C \$t; echo"
#   Be careful if "..." contains things that will be expanded by shell "eval"
#   or printf.
# hooks.emailmaxlines
#   The maximum number of lines that should be included in the generated
#   email body. If not specified, there is no limit.
#   Lines beyond the limit are suppressed and counted, and a final
#   line is added indicating the number of suppressed lines.
#
# Notes
# -----
# All emails include the headers "X-Git-Refname", "X-Git-Oldrev",
# "X-Git-Newrev", and "X-Git-Reftype" to enable fine tuned filtering and
# give information for debugging.

	echo $LOGEND
}

#
# Called for the change of a pre-existing branch
#
generate_update_branch_email()
{
	# Consider this:
	#   1 --- 2 --- O --- X --- 3 --- 4 --- N
	#
	# O is $oldrev for $refname
	# N is $newrev for $refname
	# X is a revision pointed to by some other ref, for which we may
	#   assume that an email has already been generated.
	# In this case we want to issue an email containing only revisions
	# 3, 4, and N.  Given (almost) by
	#
	#  git rev-list N ^O --not --all
	#
	# The reason for the "almost", is that the "--not --all" will take
	# precedence over the "N", and effectively will translate to
	#
	#  git rev-list N ^O ^X ^N
	#
	# So, we need to build up the list more carefully.  git rev-parse
	# will generate a list of revs that may be fed into git rev-list.
	# We can get it to make the "--not --all" part and then filter out
	# the "^N" with:
	#
	#  git rev-parse --not --all | grep -v N
	#
	# Then, using the --stdin switch to git rev-list we have effectively
	# manufactured
	#
	#  git rev-list N ^O ^X
	#
	# This leaves a problem when someone else updates the repository
	# while this script is running.  Their new value of the ref we're
	# working on would be included in the "--not --all" output; and as
	# our $newrev would be an ancestor of that commit, it would exclude
	# all of our commits.  What we really want is to exclude the current
	# value of $refname from the --not list, rather than N itself.  So:
	#
	#  git rev-parse --not --all | grep -v $(git rev-parse $refname)
	#
	# Get's us to something pretty safe (apart from the small time
	# between refname being read, and git rev-parse running - for that,
	# I give up)
	#
	#
	# Next problem, consider this:
	#   * --- B --- * --- O ($oldrev)
	#          \
	#           * --- X --- * --- N ($newrev)
	#
	# That is to say, there is no guarantee that oldrev is a strict
	# subset of newrev (it would have required a --force, but that's
	# allowed).  So, we can't simply say rev-list $oldrev..$newrev.
	# Instead we find the common base of the two revs and list from
	# there.
	#
	# As above, we need to take into account the presence of X; if
	# another branch is already in the repository and points at some of
	# the revisions that we are about to output - we don't want them.
	# The solution is as before: git rev-parse output filtered.
	#
	# Finally, tags: 1 --- 2 --- O --- T --- 3 --- 4 --- N
	#
	# Tags pushed into the repository generate nice shortlog emails that
	# summarise the commits between them and the previous tag.  However,
	# those emails don't include the full commit messages that we output
	# for a branch update.  Therefore we still want to output revisions
	# that have been output on a tag email.
	#
	# Luckily, git rev-parse includes just the tool.  Instead of using
	# "--all" we use "--branches"; this has the added benefit that
	# "remotes/" will be ignored as well.

	# List all of the revisions that were removed by this update, in a
