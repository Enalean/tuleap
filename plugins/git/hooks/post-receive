# An example hook script for the post-receive event
#
# This script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack and the
# repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through stdin
# in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master

# see contrib/hooks/ for an sample, or uncomment the next line (on debian)
