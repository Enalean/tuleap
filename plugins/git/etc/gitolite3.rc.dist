# configuration variables for gitolite

# This file is in perl syntax.  But you do NOT need to know perl to edit it --
# just mind the commas, use single quotes unless you know what you're doing,
# and make sure the brackets and braces stay matched up!

# (Tip: perl allows a comma after the last item in a list also!)

# HELP for commands can be had by running the command with "-h".

# HELP for all the other FEATURES can be found in the documentation (look for
# "list of non-core programs shipped with gitolite" in the master index) or
# directly in the corresponding source file.
