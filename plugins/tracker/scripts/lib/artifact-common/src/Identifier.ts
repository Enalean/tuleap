/*
 * PHP uses a "nominal type system" wherein instances of different classes with the same "id" field are not compatible.
 * For example, an instance of ArtifactIdentifier is not compatible with TrackerIdentifier even though they have the
 * same "shape" with a public "id" field. Their "names" are not compatible.
 *
 * TypeScript uses a "structural type system" wherein two objects with the same "shape" are compatible. As long as one
 * object has at least all the properties defined by an interface, it is considered valid for that interface.
 *
 * Structural type systems are more flexible and easier to use, but in some cases we want to be strict. We don't want
 * an ArtifactIdentifier to be allowed when we expect a TrackerIdentifier, even though they have the same shape.
 * There are several ways to "force incompatibility", this one has the advantage of avoiding type assertions.
