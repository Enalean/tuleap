/**
 * This interface should be implemented by all classes that are able to represent
 * themselves to a PHP / json compatible format.
 * The output of this is supposed to be passed to 'json_encode' as is.
 *
 * WARNING: please represent yourself as a JSON equivalent of your data.
 * if your properties are 'id', 'name, 'foo_bar' your json representation should
 * be:
 * array(
 *   'id' => /.../
 *   'name' => /.../
 *   'foo_bar /.../
 * );
 *
 * If, for some reasons, you should format your data in a different fashion (to
 * map an external API for instance, you must declare a specific method for this
 * purpose).
 * The global idea is to ensure consistency across implementation (JS, PHP, etc)
 * with same terms and behaviours.
