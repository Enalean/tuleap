Hi Manuel,

I think pagination would go a long way in solving this. Seeing the 10 (or however many) most recent changes would be totally reasonable and should scale well. I think that’s probably the best approach.

Hi,

We have a project with a large number of Follow-Ups, approx. 120. The main page content loads quickly, but then takes many minutes to slowly load the followups at the bottom of the page (which it seems to load one-by-one).

There is probably a performance imporvement to be made here.


There is a ‘Display Settings’ option for ‘Changes are Displayed’: is it possible to make this disabled by default or stop the changes from being loaded unless the user wants to see each change?

This can be done is the code (ie. not by configuration)
But I'm wondering if it's the right option, maybe the issue here is that it's not a good idea to display 120 (or more) follow-up at once.

Maybe it would be better to do an infinit scroll (ala twitter/FB/...) or a simple pagination to reduce the amount of element to display.

What do you think ?
