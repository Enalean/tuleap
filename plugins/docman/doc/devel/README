!!! Document Overview

This document aims to give major keys of the architecture of the plugin.

This document can be found here:
* https://partners.xrce.xerox.com/wiki/index.php?pagename=DocmanImplementation&group_id=120 
* src/plugins/docman/doc/devel/README

!!! Architecture

Docman plugin is based on MVC (model/view/controler) pattern. This application layout is common and we won't detail it here. 
The docman uses also widely some other patterns:
* Factories (aka Business Objects)
* ~DataAccessObjects (DAO).
* Visitor

!! Factories / Business Objects debate

These two patterns are equivalent and both are used in Codex.

However, we decided to only use Factory name for developments, new developments shouldn't add new '*Bo' classes. We migrate old code to new standard step by step.

Note: the major change is to merge the 2 classes ItemFactory and ItemBo in only one class.

!! Principles

[Upload:DocmanImplementationClassDiagram.png]

The main principle are:
* SQL and/or Filesystem access are made in Dao and *only* in Dao.
* Factories offer an high level view of the model.
* Data are travelling in the application encapsulated in Transport Objects (aka Containers).
  * example: Docman_Item and subclasses, Docman_Metadata, ....
  * a container is stupid, factory is the brain.
* When Views and Actions are dealing with Model Layer, they only talk with Factories
  * For instance an Action (new_document) create a new Container (Docman_Wiki) with data from user input and asks to the Factory (Docman_~ItemBo) to preform some actions (create it).
* Controler job is to receive request from user, perform Actions and display Views following the request.
* Views and Actions should never directly access to requests parameters.

! Organization of documents

* Documents are sorted in a tree.
* Each node of this tree is an Item.
* There are 2 main categories of Items: Folders and Documents.
* A Document can be a Link, a Wiki, an Empty.
* Items and Document are abstract classes.

* We use Visitor pattern to walk trhough the Item hierarchy.

!! Organisation of the code

* Model
 * High end
  * ItemFactory
  * ItemBo
  * FolderBo
  * ...
  * *Factory

 * Backend
  * FolderDao
  * ItemDao
  * ...
  * *Dao

* Transport object
  * Folder
  * Item

* View
  * DocmanViews
  * views/*

* Controler
  * Docman.class
  * SOAPDocman.class.php

* Action
  * DocmanActions.class

* Plugin
  * docmanPlugin.class
  * DocmanPluginDescriptor.class
  * DocmanPluginInfo.class

!!! How does it work ?

!! Display item tree.

* DocmanController receive a request from the user to display the docman content:
 * url: http://..../plugins/docman/index.php?group_id=101&action=show&id=134
 * params: group_id of the project
 * action: show ... shows (!) "something"
 * id: id of the "something" to show, it refers to an item.

* DocmanController (in request method) set-up the view to use to display the tree

* The corresponding view (Docman_View_Tree for instance) set-up the tree to display
 * $itemBo = new Docman_ItemBo(101); // group_id
 * $itemTree = $itemBo->getItemSubTree(134); // id
 * Note: for purists, this should be done by the Controller himself.

* Once the tree is fetched, the view requires to display it with a visitor.
 * we choose to display it with UlTreeViewVisitor:
 * $visitor = new Docman_View_ItemTreeUlVisitor();
 * $itemTree->accept($visitor);
 * the visitor walk through the tree and build, node per node, the final view.

* Last step is to display the view builded by the visitor:
 * print $visitor->toHtml();


!!! Metadata

!! Note

The current implementation of the metadata is rather complex and there is one rework to do. We have to remove the useage of MetadataValue object to handle metadata values.

The Metadata object should both describe the metadata and store the values.

!! Introduction & main concepts

[Upload:docman_metadata.png]

Metadata code is organized in 3 "categories" of classes:
* Metadata
* ~MetadataValue
* ~MetadataListOfValueElement

Each category behaviour is splitted in 3 parts:
* container (Green on class diagram).
* data access object (Light grey on class diagram).
* factory (Dark grey on class diagram).

HTML output of the metadata is handled by ~MetadataHtml objects.

!! Metadata
Metadata management is covered by ~Docman_Metadata* classes:

* ~Docman_Metadata is the container. It's used as an class abstraction of the table 'plugin_docman_metadata'. One record in this table correspond to one instance of ~Docman_Metadata class.
  * ~Docman_ListMetadata is the container of metadata that provide a list of values in addition to the default metadata info.

* ~Docman_MetadataDao is the access to database object. It perform all SQL queries to manipulate and fetch data in the DB. Related SQL tables:
  * plugin_docman_metadata

* ~Docman_MetadataFactory is an high level interface to handle ~Docman_Metadata. All operation related to Metadata are available in this class.

!! MetadataValue
~MetadataValue* classes are used to handle values of metadata for a given item. ~MetadataValue (and related SQL tables) perfom the link between field definition (Metadata) and the item (Item).

* ~Docman_MetadataValue is the container. This is the class that represent the SQL table 'plugin_metadata_value'. ~Docman_MetadataValue is an abstract class, the 2 concrete classes are:
  * ~Docman_MetadataValueScalar when a metadata only accept one value per item.
  * ~Docman_MetadataValueList when we can have several values for one metadata for a given item (for instance: multiple selection box).

* ~Docman_MetadataValueDao handle all access to database related to metadata values management.
Related SQL tables:
  * plugin_docman_metadata_value

* ~Docman_MetadataValueFactory is an high level interface to manipulate metadata values.

!! ~MetadataListOfValueElement

~MetadataListOfValueElement* classes handle access to ~ListOfValues metadata. ~ListOfValues metadata is a special type of metadata that provide a list of elements and user should pick up one (or many) in the list. 

From the database point of view:
* the ~ListOfValues elements are stored in 'plugin_docman_listofvalues'
* the link between 'plugin_docman_listofvalues' and  'plugin_docman_metadata' is stored in 'plugin_docman_listofvalues_metadata'.
* the link between Item and chosen element for given metadata is stored in 'valueInt' field of 'plugin_docman_metadata_value'.

* ~MetadataListOfValueElement is a container that represent the SQL table 'plugin_docman_listofvalues'. It represent one element of the list of choices.

* ~MetadataListOfValueElementDao handle access to database for 'plugin_docman_listofvalues'.

* ~MetadataListOfValueElementFactory is an high level interface to manipulate list of values elements.

!!! Ways of improvements

!! Management of tree

- We should use nested tree for better preformances in tree view. This will allows to retreive only a subtree directly.
  - This approach requires to have an ACID compliant engine (Innodb)

!! Management of list

- To be more efficient in list view we should:
  - have a dedicted SQL query that drop the folders and retreive only the number of documents wanted. This query needs to be joined on the permissions table to achieve that.

  - once we get the list of files, we have to loop on the parent until root to be able to build the 'Location' part of the display. (~1 query per level-up).
