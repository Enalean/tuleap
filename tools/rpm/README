Tuleap RPMS
===========

How to rebuild
==============

Requirements
------------
* On the OS: you need 'make' 'rpmbuild' and 'create-repo' RPM packages to be installed
  on your system before to start
  Minimal requirement is to run:
  yum -y install make

Set the environment
-------------------
This assume sh-like shell, for csh-like use setenv.

$> export RPM_TMP=/path/to/rpm/build/directory

Build only tuleap RPM
---------------------

* For RHEL6: make OS=rhel6 clean rpmprep rpm

Build the packages
------------------
Just type 'make all', the packages will be generated into $RPM_TMP/RPMS

If you only care about the sources, 'make tarball' will only generate the
source package (much more quick).
