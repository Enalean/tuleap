There are preconfigured profiles for cucumber (in .config/cucumber.yml) you can use them by

for a list of profiles just enter a non existing profile, cucumber will show which ones are available
for instance 
$> cucumber -p blabla

Installation & Setup
====================

# The recommended way to setup the whole platform is to rely on a local ruby installation.

RVM
===
RVM is the easiest way to build your own ruby in your homedir.

First, install it:
bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )

# Load rvm:
. $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm

# Check all requirements are installed
rvm requirements
-> look for "additional dependencies" and install what is needed by "# For Ruby / Ruby HEAD (MRI, Rubinius, & REE), install the following:" section.

# Install ruby head
rvm install ruby-1.8.7-head

# Load your ruby in your environement:
$> rvm use ruby-1.8.7-head
$> which ruby
/home/manuel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-head/bin/ruby
$> which gem
/home/manuel/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-head/bin/gem

# Install gems
gem install rspec cucumber capybara capybara-screenshot selenium

Environement
============

# add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc and source it
. $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm use ruby-1.8.7-head

Running with webkit (faster selenium) 
===================
apt-get install libqt4-dev
gem install capybara-screenshot
gem install capybara-webkit
# Note: you need capybara-webkit-0.8 minimum
