Version 4.0.16 - Tuesday, 18th January 2011
        == New Features ==
        backlog #113540: Support of <pre> in tracker follow-up comment
                         * Follow-up comments can be submitted with usage of a subset
                           of HTML markups: p, br, a, img, ul, ol, li, cite, code, blockquote, strong, em, pre, b, i
                           This modification comes with a rich text editor in the  follow-up comment text area.
                           It's possible to add comment in HTML with SOAP and Codendi_CLI too (but no update yet).
	  Following tickets were addressed:
	  * feature #codex:101884: Improve the mail notification
	  * bug #codex:116656:     It is not possible to update the Release ChangeLog when we add a file in FRS (with CLI script)
	  * bug codexstn #13752:   Releases permissions checking don't take into account frs admin / project admin perms

                         * Fix wrong behaviour in CSV import/export that was leading to comments duplication.
                           Known limitations: It's not possible to import follow-up comments in HTML format yet.

                         * Improvement of Artifact edition UI:
                           * reduce space "lost" between tracker's toolbar and artifact info.
                           * rework of follow-up comments layout to improve readability.

	backlog #114221: File Release System provides means to check files consistency through md5 sums.
	                 * Codendi automatically computes md5 sum on files submitted in File Release System.
	                   If you submit a reference md5 sum, Codendi compares with the computed one and raise
	                   an error if it fails. Enhance the notification mail received while monitoring a package.

	                 * CLI update to 1.4.0, see cli/ChangeLog for details.

	                 * SOAP API update to version 4.1, see src/www/soap/ChangeLog for details.
