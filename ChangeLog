                           It's possible to add comment in HTML with SOAP and Codendi_CLI too (but no update yet).
	  Following tickets were addressed:
	  * feature #codex:101884: Improve the mail notification

	                   an error if it fails. Enhance the notification mail received while monitoring a package. 

	                 * CLI update to 1.4.0, see cli/ChangeLog for details.
