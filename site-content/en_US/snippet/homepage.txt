	The purpose of this archive is to let you share your code snippets with the rest of <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?>. Code snippets are small pieces of code like scripts, macros, 
	and functions that does not require a full project environment to be put in place.
	<P>
	You can create a new code snippet, then post additional versions of that 
	snippet quickly and easily.
	<P>
	Once you have code snippets posted, you can also group code snippets together by creating a "Package" of snippets. 
	That package can contain multiple, specific versions of individual code snippets.
