<h2><?=$GLOBALS['sys_name']?> Terms of Service Agreement</h2>
<p>
<B>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</B> 
</p>

<p>
A person's use of <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> and any of its Services (as defined below) at
any time is subject to <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> then-current Terms of Service ("TOS"),
which may be updated from time to time as set forth below. Each user can
review the then-current TOS at any time at:
<a href="/tos/tos.php"><?php print \HTTPRequest::instance()->getServerUrl(); ?>/tos/tos.php</a>.  In addition, each user's use of
particular Services may be subject to specific guidelines or rules
("Service-specific Rules") posted from time to time and incorporated by this
reference into the TOS.  A user's use of  <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> and/or its Services
constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the TOS; if a user does not
accept our TOS, he or she is not granted rights to use <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> or any of
its Services, as defined herein, and should refrain from accessing
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> and its Services.
</p>

<p>
With any change to the
core TOS, we will email notice of the change to known users at least 15 days in advance.  If we change any Service-specific Rules, we
will post the changed version on the location where those Service-specific
Rules normally appear,  reference the change on the primary page for that
Service and include a link to the previous version of the rules.
</p>

<p>
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify
or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> or any Service
thereon (or any part thereof) with notice to users and the public as
described above, or immediately in the event of technical difficulties.
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any
such modification, suspension or discontinuance except as expressly provided
herein.
</p>
<p>
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> is a website owned and operated by <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> for
the purpose of fostering the cross-organizational software development as well as content and source code sharing under
 the terms of the <b><u><a href="<?php echo $exchange_policy_url; ?>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Code eXchange Policy</a></b></u>.  Registering your project on <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> implies that you fully understand this corporate policy and take the commitment to comply with it.
<p>
<B>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</B> 
</p>

<p>
<P>
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> currently offers users access to a
rich collection of on-line resources for <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> internal software  development
and content creation, including various  communications tools, source code
control and project management tools, online forums (collectively, the "Services").
</p>

<p>
<B>3. REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</B> 
</p>

<p>
If required by the site in question, each user must: (a) provide true,
accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration
form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly
update the Registration Data as necessary. If, after investigation, we have
reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue,
inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that
user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the
Services (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly
provided herein.
</p>

<p>
Each user will receive a password and account designation upon completing
the Service's registration process and is wholly responsible for maintaining
the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring
thereunder.    <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section, including
any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to (a) immediately notify
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any
other breach of security and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her
account at the end of each session.
</p>


<p>
<B>4. CONTENT</B> 
</p>

<p>
All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics,
video, messages or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, "Content"),
whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole
responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means
that the user, and not the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> team, is entirely responsible for all Content
that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>
 or any Service. No user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or
participate in any activities on <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> and/or any Service which, in
the opinion of <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> counsel, are in contradiction with <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> internal policies.
</p>

<p>
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> will not pre-screen or review Content, but <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> reserves
the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it becomes aware which it
reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose. In addition, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> shall
have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or
delete any Content which it reasonably considers to violate the TOS or be
otherwise illegal. <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> does not control the Content posted via
the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or
quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> be liable
in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any
errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind
incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise
transmitted via <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> or any Service thereon.
</p>


<p>
<B>5. GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE</B> 
</p>

<p>
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the
Services, as defined by posted Service-specific Rules.  While <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>
 will use reasonable efforts to backup site data and make such data
available in the event of loss or deletion, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> has no
responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any
messages and other communications or other Content maintained or transmitted
by any Service. <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> reserves the right to mark as "inactive" and
archive accounts and/or projects that are inactive for an extended period of
time. <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> reserves the right to change these general practices and
Service-specific Rules at any time, in its sole discretion, with notice to
users and the public as described in Section 1 above.
</p>

<p>
<B>6. TERMINATION</B>
</p>

<p>
A user's account may be terminated for reasons that include, but are not
limited to, the following:  1.) violation of these TOS;  2.) abuse of site
resources or attempt to gain unauthorized entry to the site or site
resources; 3.) use of Service in a manner inconsistent with the Purpose; 4.)
a user's request for such termination; and 5.) requirement of applicable
 <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> policies (e.g. employee leaving the company).
</p>

<p>
Termination of any user's access to <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> or any Service
hereunder may be effected without notice and, on such termination,
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> may immediately deactivate or delete user's account and/or bar
any further access to such files, that Service or <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>.  <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>
 shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any termination of
that user's access or account hereunder.
</p>
