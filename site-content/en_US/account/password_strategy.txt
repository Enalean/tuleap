You can customize password validation rules by editing this file in /etc/codendi/site-content/.../account directories.
- you can use PasswordRegexpValidator, as described below.
- you may also create your own validators. Here is an example:

class MyPasswordValidator extends PasswordValidator {

   function MyPasswordValidator() {
      $this->PasswordValidator('The description of my validator, displayed when choosing a password');
   }

   function validate($pwd) {
      //Check that the $pwd is valid
      ...
      return false || true;
   }
}


*/



/*
Below is your strategy used to validate the passwords.
Feel free to (un)comment the following lines to feed your needs.
Do not forget to add your custom validators.

*/
$password_strategy->add(new PasswordRegexpValidator('/.{8,}/', 'The password must contains at least 8 characters.'));
//$password_strategy->add(new PasswordRegexpValidator('/[^a-zA-Z0-9]{2,}/', 'The password must contains at least 2 special characters.'));
//$password_strategy->add(new PasswordRegexpValidator('/[a-z]{1,}/', 'The password must contains a lowercase letter.'));
//$password_strategy->add(new PasswordRegexpValidator('/[A-Z]{1,}/', 'The password must contains an uppercase letter.'));
//$password_strategy->add(new PasswordRegexpValidator('/[0-9]{1,}/', 'The password must contains a number.'));
//$password_strategy->add(new MyPasswordValidator());
