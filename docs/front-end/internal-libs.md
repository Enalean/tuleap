# Internal Javascript Libraries

## In which situation do I need a library ?

-   When you need to share code between two apps or endpoints
-   When the shared code has at least one NPM dependency
-   When the shared code needs translated strings (gettext)
-   When you want a common endpoint to include Javascript and CSS styles
-   When you need to share code between a TypeScript app and a plain Javascript app
-   When you want to share a Vue component

## When NOT to create a library ?

-   When the code uses dynamic import, for example to load polyfills or translations. In this case, use a standard vite configuration
-   When you need to output a file with a revision hash in its name, for example `my-lib-name-0123456aea.js`. In this case, use a standard vite configuration.

## Folder structure of an internal library

Create a `lib/frontend/` folder in Tuleap Core or in the plugin where code is shared:

```sh
# In core
$> mkdir -p tuleap/lib/frontend/my-lib-name/ && cd tuleap/lib/frontend/my-lib-name/
# In a plugin
$> mkdir -p tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/ && cd tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/
```

Here is the folder structure you should follow:

```sh
my-plugin/
 |-- build-manifest.json # Edit it to declare your lib for translations
 |-- scripts/
      |-- lib/
           |-- my-lib-name/
                |-- .gitignore          # Exclude dist/ from git
                |-- package.json        # Declares the library name, its dependencies and its build scripts.
                |-- pnpm-lock.yaml      # Generated by pnpm. Never edit manually.
                |-- tsconfig.json       # Typescript configuration
                |-- vite.config.ts      # Vite configuration to build the lib
                |-- images/                             # Images to include in the lib's CSS
                     |-- some-image.png
                |-- dist/                               # Generated assets. Must be excluded from git
                     |-- index.d.ts                     # Typescript declarations, it is referenced in "types" exports in package.json
                     |-- my-lib-name.umd.cjs            # Javascript UMD bundle, it is referenced in "require" exports in package.json
                     |-- my-lib-name.js                 # Javascript ES module bundle, it is referenced in "import" exports in package.json
                     |-- my-lib-name.css                # CSS bundle, it is referenced in "sass" exports in package.json
                |-- po/                                 # Localization strings
                     |-- fr_FR.po                       # Localized strings for French
                |-- src/                                # The lib source code
                     |-- main.ts                        # Entrypoint for your library
                     |-- subfolder/
                          |-- my-other-source.ts
                |-- themes/                             # The lib styles
                     |-- style.scss                     # Entrypoint for your library styles
```

## Build your internal library

The build system will read `build-manifest.json` to understand how and
where it needs to extract translated strings.

```json5
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/build-manifest.json
{
    "name": "my-plugin",
    "gettext-ts": {
        "my-lib-name": {
            "src": "src/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/src",
            "po": "src/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/po"
        }
    }
}
```

Create manually the `fr_FR.po` file. When you run `make generate-po`, this file is NOT created, but it will be filled with the translations.

```text
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/po/fr_FR.po
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: \n"
"PO-Revision-Date: \n"
"Last-Translator: Your Full Name <your email address>\n"
"Language-Team: \n"
"Language: fr\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n > 1);\n"
```

To build up your library, you will have to create a `vite.config.ts` file. This file should be located in `my-lib-name/`.

```typescript
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/vite.config.ts
import { vite, viteDtsPlugin } from "@tuleap/build-system-configurator";
import * as path from "node:path";

export default vite.defineLibConfig({
    plugins: [viteDtsPlugin()],
    build: {
        lib: {
            entry: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/main.ts"),
            name: "MyLibName",
        },
        // Exclude an external dependency from the lib's bundle
        rollupOptions: {
            external: ["dompurify"],
            output: {
                globals: {
                    dompurify: "DOMPurify",
                },
            },
        },
    }
});
```

Once you have a Vite config, you will need a `package.json` in `my-lib-name/`.

```json5
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/package.json
{
  "author": "Enalean Team",                   // or yourself
  "name": "@tuleap/my-lib-name",
  "homepage": "https://tuleap.org",           // or your lib's homepage
  "license": "GPL-2.0-or-later",              // or your license
  "private": true,                            // to avoid accidentally publishing on NPM registry
  "type": "module",                           // Allow import/export instead of require()
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",               // Generated TypeScript declarations
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      // Order matters here, declare TypeScript first, then Sass
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",           // Generated TypeScript declarations
      "sass": "./dist/my-lib-name.css",       // The CSS bundle of your lib.
      "import": "./dist/my-lib-name.js",      // The Javascript ES Module bundle of your lib
      "require": "./dist/my-lib-name.umd.cjs" // The Javascript UMD bundle of your lib
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dompurify": "^2.3.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tuleap/build-system-configurator": "workspace:*",
    "@types/dompurify": "^2.3.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "build": "vite build",
    "watch": "vite build --watch --mode development --minify false",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

All the Vite dependencies are available at the tuleap root folder.

Use the pnpm scripts to build the library or to run the unit tests.

```sh
pnpm run typecheck # Run TypeScript type check on your code and unit tests.
pnpm run build     # For a production build, outputs minified code.
pnpm run watch     # Build the lib in watch mode.
pnpm test          # Run the Vitest unit tests only once.
```

In order to test the library in real conditions (with your browser), you need to also include it in an application AND also rebuild that application.

Once you have a `package.json` file, you will also need a `tsconfig.json` file to configure Typescript.

```json5
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/tsconfig.json
{
    "extends": "@tuleap/build-system-configurator/tsc/tsconfig-for-libraries.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
        "lib": ["ES2023", "DOM"], // Add values like "DOM" if your lib interacts with the DOM
        "types": ["jest"],  // Add global types needed by your lib
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

Add a `.gitignore` file to remove the `dist/` folder from source control. It contains only generated files and should not be committed.

```ignorelang
# tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/.gitignore
dist/
```

If you have gettext translations with node-gettext, you will need a `pofile-shim.d.ts` file so that TypeScript understands what is returned by `import "file.po"`.

```typescript
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/src/pofile-shim.d.ts
declare module "*.po" {
    import type { GettextParserPoFile } from "@tuleap/gettext";
    const content: GettextParserPoFile;
    export default content;
}
```

In your stylesheet, you can reference images. They will be inlined (converted to a base64 string) and included in `dist/my-lib-name.css`.

```scss
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/themes/style.scss
.some-css-class {
    // The image will be converted to a base64 string
    background: url('../images/some-image.png');
}
```

Finally, your `main.ts` file (the lib entrypoint) should export types that callers will need. Exporting them will ensure that the generated `index.d.ts` declaration file references those types. Also note that you need to import the style file you referenced in your `package.json` so that it can be processed by Vite.

```typescript
// tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/src/index.ts
import "../themes/style.scss"; // Import the styles to bundle them in dist/my-lib-name.css
import type { MyType, MyOtherType } from "./types";

export type { MyType, MyOtherType }; // Re-export the types, so that TypeScript callers can import them
export function myFunction(param: MyType): MyOtherType {
    //...
}
```

## Use your library from another application

To use your library from another application, you must first declare it as a dependency in the app's `package.json` file. Use `pnpm add @tuleap/my-lib-name` to achieve that. You will get something looking like this:

```json5
// tuleap/plugins/other-plugin/package.json
{
  "name": "@tuleap/other-plugin",
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@tuleap/my-lib-name": "workspace:^" // Add your lib as a dependency
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "..."
  }
}
```

Use the library like any other npm module in Javascript / Typescript files:

```typescript
// tuleap/plugins/other-plugin/scripts/other-app/src/other-file.ts
import type { MyOtherType } from "@tuleap/my-lib-name";
import { myFunction } from "@tuleap/my-lib-name";

const result: MyOtherType = myFunction(param);
```

Import the CSS styles like any other npm module in SCSS files:

```scss
// tuleap/plugins/other-plugin/themes/BurningParrot/src/other-file.scss
@use "pkg:@tuleap/my-lib-name";
```

## Making changes to your library

While working on your library, changes will NOT be automatically visible from the application. Both the library and the application MUST be rebuilt in order to see your changes.

```sh
$> (cd tuleap/plugins/my-plugin/scripts/lib/my-lib-name/ && pnpm run watch) & (cd tuleap/plugins/other-plugin/ && pnpm run watch) && fg
# CTRL-C twice to exit both watches
```
