# Tuleap release process

This section describes release processes of Tuleap and is only relevant
for contributors endorsing the role of release manager.

A release manager needs to:

-   be a Tuleap integrator
-   at least be a tracker administrator in the project Tuleap on
    [Tuleap.net](https://tuleap.net/projects/tuleap/)

## Release a new Tuleap Community milestone

A new Tuleap Community milestone can be released once:

-   the set of features included in the release has been validated
    by the Product Owner
-   full validation test suite has been passed with success (all
    major spotted bugs has been fixed)
-   no Tuleap integrator has manifested himself with a reason to
    block the release

### Prepare the source repositories for the release

The source repositories must be prepared to release a new Tuleap
Community milestone. The release manager **must** sign with his GPG key
any commits or any tags created during the release process.

This document consider that X.Y is the version number of Tuleap that you
want to release.

#### Tuleap

You should retrieve the sources of the master branch of the [Tuleap
Community
repository](https://tuleap.net/plugins/git/tuleap/tuleap/stable). You
will also need a remote to the [Tuleap repository on
Gerrit](https://gerrit.tuleap.net/admin/repos/tuleap). The top of the
master branch must be what you want to release. Your workspace copy must
be up to date and at the top of the master branch.

1.  Update `VERSION` to the X.Y version you are releasing

2.  Commit:

        $ git commit -S -a -m 'This is Tuleap X.Y'

3.  Tag:

        $ git tag -s -m 'Create tag for Tuleap X.Y' X.Y

4.  Publish your commit and tag:

        $ git push stable HEAD:master
        $ git push gerrit HEAD:master
        $ git push stable X.Y

### Update Tuleap.net

-   [Create a fake release in the
    FRS](https://tuleap.net/file/admin/release.php?func=add&group_id=101&package_id=5)
    with the release artifact ID
-   Mark the release artifact as delivered in the [Releases
    tracker](https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?tracker=146)
-   [Edit the Version
    field](https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?tracker=143&func=admin-formElements)
    to add the new release and to hide the oldest one

## Release a new major Tuleap Enterprise milestone

This can only be done after the release of a Tuleap Community milestone.
This guide only covers the release of a new major Tuleap Enterprise
milestone as it is closely related to the release of a Tuleap Community
milestone.

Publishing a new Tuleap Enterprise milestone is only possible for Tuleap
integrators with an access to Enalean internal repositories.

### Prepare the source repositories for the release

Similarly to the release of a Tuleap Community milestone, every tag and
commit created during the process **must** be signed by the release
manager.

#### Tuleap

You must publish the tag to the Tuleap Enterprise repository:

    $ git push enterprise X.Y

#### Documentation

Both the [English
documentation](https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap-documentation-en) and
[French
documentation](https://github.com/Enalean/tuleap-documentation-fr) must
be updated, so you need to clone both repositories.

1. Verify that the deployment guide in the english documentation is up
to date. You can partially achieve that by checking if there was changes
in the configuration files:

    $ git diff X.W..X.Y -- plugins/*/etc/ src/etc

2.  Create a branch specific to the release in the English and French
    documentation repositories:

        $ git checkout -b X.Y origin/master

3.  Edit, if needed, the copyright, version and release:

        # In English documentation repository
        $ vim languages/en/conf.py
        # In French documentation repository
        $ vim languages/fr/conf.py

4.  Edit, if needed, the deployment guide to remove the mention \"Under
    development\"

5.  Commit your changes and publish them:

        # In English documentation repository
        $ git commit -S -a -m 'Initialize documentation for Tuleap X.Y'
        # In French documentation repository
        $ git commit -S -a -m 'Initialisation de la documentation de Tuleap X.Y'
        # In both repositories
        $ git push -u origin HEAD

6. On ``origin/master`` for English documentation, edit the deployment guide to remove the mention "Under
   development" for the just published release ``X.Y`` and create a new chapter for the
   upcoming release ``X.Z`` that is now "Under development". Commit and push:

        $ git checkout origin/master
        $ EDITOR ...
        $ git commit -S -a -m 'Start development of X.Z'
        $ git push origin HEAD:master

### Update the manifest

What goes into a Tuleap Enterprise milestone is defined by a manifest
file.

1.  Clone or update your local copy of the [release-manifest
    repository](https://my.enalean.com/plugins/git/tuleap-by-enalean/release-manifest)

2.  Edit the release manifest file located in
    `manifest.json` with the tags you have created for the
    release (do not forget the `links` keys)

3.  Commit the new manifest and publish it:

        $ git commit -S -a -m 'Release Tuleap Enterprise X.Y'
        $ git push

### Build and publish packages

Building and publishing the packages is fully automated through a
Jenkins pipeline. The [pipeline will
start](https://ci.enalean.com/jenkins/job/RPMs/job/TuleapEnterprise/) as
soon as you publish the updated manifest.

### Update my.enalean.com

Edit the [Version
field](https://my.enalean.com/plugins/tracker/?tracker=221&func=admin-formElements)
to add the new release and to hide the oldest one.

## Release a JS library developed in the main Tuleap repository

This section is only useful if you want to release a new version of a JS
library developed in the [main Tuleap
repository](https://tuleap.net/plugins/git/tuleap/tuleap/stable).
Please refer to the [relevant adr](./decisions/0009-publish-js-lib-registry.md) for the rationale about it.

Only a Tuleap integrator can trigger a release.

To release a new version, you need to:

1.  Make sure the `version` field of the `package.json` of your
    library has been incremented (see [SemVer](https://semver.org/) to
    determine how to increment it) and the changelog updated.

2.  If the version needs to be incremented or the changelog updated,
    submit the changes to review

3.  Checkout to the Tuleap version where your package version has been
    incremented

4.  Tag your new version and publish the tag:

        $ git tag -s -m '<PACKAGE_NAME> v<VERSION>' <PACKAGE_NAME>_<VERSION>
        $ git push stable <PACKAGE_NAME>_<VERSION>

5.  Trigger the [pipeline to publish your new version to the npmjs.com
    registry](https://ci.tuleap.org/jenkins/job/Publish_JS_libraries/job/Main_Tuleap_repository/)
