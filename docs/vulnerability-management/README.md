# Vulnerability management for the Tuleap project

The Tuleap project handles vulnerabilities affecting it the following ways:
* **vulnerability affecting code owned by the Tuleap project**: using the [Tuleap vulnerability response process][0].
* **vulnerability affecting the infrastructure deployed to support the development and distribution of Tuleap**:
handled by [Enalean](https://www.tuleap.org/company/about-us) Infra team per Enalean internal incident management
policy. Those vulnerabilities do not warrant the publication of an advisory. However, if the confidentiality or integrity
of data is impacted a communication will be made towards the concerned individuals or the Tuleap Community and Enterprise
community.
* **vulnerability affecting code not owned by the Tuleap project**:
    - if the vulnerability is public: the Tuleap development team work on it publicly in the
[Tuleap Requests tracker](https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?tracker=140). The vulnerability is expected to be fixed
by either pulling the upstream fix or mitigating it using any means that seems appropriate to the development team. The
fix is expected to be shipped the within the same delay as [vulnerability affecting Tuleap own code][0].
    - if the vulnerability is not public: the Tuleap Security team will attempt to contact the owners of the impacted
project and coordinates the remediation with different actors involved in the discovery. The Tuleap Security team might
mitigate the vulnerability in the Tuleap project in order to protect Tuleap users. If the situation occurs (notably if
the owners of the impacted projects are not responsive) the [Tuleap vulnerability response process][0] will be used.

For vulnerabilities not affecting the Tuleap project but for which the Tuleap Security team has been made aware of by
an external reporter, the Tuleap Security team will encourage the reporter to contact the proper organization. In these
situations the Tuleap Security team will not disclose the issue publicly. The Tuleap Security team might however relay
the information to impacted organization or to authorities such as [CERT-FR](https://cyber.gouv.fr/en-cas-dincident)
especially if the issue involves Personal Identifying Information.
