# Contribution

All developments should be announced by [opening a request on
Tuleap.net](https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?tracker=140) and/or at
least start a discussion about it in the [#general channel on the
chat](https://chat.tuleap.org/).

By announcing what you want to do in advance, you limit the risk of
developing something that will not be integrated because it conflicts
with plan/vision of other developers. Moreover, you can get meaningful
feedback on what to do and how to do it.

By all means try to contribute small things. It\'s far easier to review
and integrate 100 lines of diff in 3 files rather than 5000 lines in 30
files.

## Present a new feature

For new features, the best way to present them is one (or several) user
stories written on the \"In order to \<receive benefit> as a \<role>, I
want \<goal/desire>\" model. A good user story is a story worth to
INVEST on:

-   Independant
-   Negotiable
-   Valuable
-   Estimable
-   Small
-   Testable
