# Changelog

## 2.7.0

* 💄 Update Tuleap logo

## 2.6.1

* 🐛 Bring back config reactivity that was removed during the bump vue: 3.2.37 -> 3.3.4 (introduced by 2.4.0)

## 2.6.0

* ✨ Now promoted items can have subitems. This allows for example to display Backlog » Releases » Sprint.
* ✨ Now tools can have an info tooltip. A question mark icon will be displayed next to the tool name and the tooltip will display the information on hover.
* 🚸 Promoted items (and subitems) have a larger target click area. If users click on the highlighted row, they are redirected to the item (before they had to explicitly click on the label). This behavior is consistent with the one for tools.

## 2.5.0

* Collapse of the sidebar is no longer deprecated.
* When sidebar is collapsed, the services are no longer displayed.

## 2.4.0

* 🚸 In order to not clutter the sidebar when the number of linked projects is too big,
  a new configuration variable is added: `project.linked_projects.nb_max_projects_before_popover`.
  When the number of linked projects exceeds this limit, then they are no more displayed in the sidebar,
  only in the popover on click. Default is `5`.
* 🐛 Linked projects displayed in the popover are now clickable links
* 🐛 fix broken style for arrow on linked projects popover
* 🐛 fix broken links in README
* ⬆️ Bump vue: 3.2.37 -> 3.3.4

## 2.3.0

* Tools can have promoted items, they will be displayed as a sub list when the sidebar is expanded.
* Collapse of the sidebar is deprecated. A boolean `is_collapsible` is now part of the configuration to control the behavior.

## 2.2.4

* `process.env.NODE_ENV` is removed from the distributed files so the element can be used without a bundler
