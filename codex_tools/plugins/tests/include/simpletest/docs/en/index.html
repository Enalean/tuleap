<h2>Using the tester quickly</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                Amongst software testing tools, a unit tester is the one
                closest to the developer.
                In the context of agile development the test code sits right
                next to the source code as both are written simultaneously.
                In this context SimpleTest aims to be a complete PHP developer
                test solution and is called "Simple" because it
                should be easy to use and extend.
                It wasn't a good choice of name really.
                It includes all of the typical functions you would expect from
                <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> and the
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpunit/">PHPUnit</a>
                ports, but also adds
                <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com">mock objects</a>.
                It has some <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebunit/">JWebUnit</a>
                functionality as well.
                This includes web page navigation, cookie testing and form submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                The quickest way to demonstrate is with an example.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us suppose we are testing a simple file logging class called
                <span class="new_code">Log</span> in <em>classes/log.php</em>.
                We start by creating a test script which we will call
                <em>tests/log_test.php</em> and populate it as follows...
<pre>
&lt;?php<strong>
require_once('simpletest/unit_tester.php');
require_once('simpletest/reporter.php');
require_once('../classes/log.php');

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
}</strong>
?&gt;
</pre>
                Here the <em>simpletest</em> folder is either local or in the path.
                You would have to edit these locations depending on where you
                placed the toolset.
                The <span class="new_code">TestOfLogging</span> is our frst test case and it's
                currently empty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we have five lines of scaffolding code and still no tests.
                However from this part on we get return on our investment very quickly.
                We'll assume that the <span class="new_code">Log</span> class
                takes the file name to write to in the constructor and we have
                a temporary folder in which to place this file...
<pre>
&lt;?php
require_once('simpletest/unit_tester.php');
require_once('simpletest/reporter.php');
require_once('../classes/log.php');

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    <strong>
    function testCreatingNewFile() {
        @unlink('/temp/test.log');
        $log = new Log('/temp/test.log');
        $this-&gt;assertFalse(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));
        $log-&gt;message('Should write this to a file');
        $this-&gt;assertTrue(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));
    }</strong>
}
?&gt;
</pre>
                When a test case runs it will search for any method that
                starts with the string <span class="new_code">test</span>
                and execute that method.
                We would normally have more than one test method of course.
                Assertions within the test methods trigger messages to the
                test framework which displays the result immediately.
                This immediate response is important, not just in the event
                of the code causing a crash, but also so that
                <span class="new_code">print</span> statements can display
                their content right next to the test case concerned.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see these results we have to actually run the tests.
                If this is the only test case we wish to run we can achieve
                it with...
<pre>
&lt;?php
require_once('simpletest/unit_tester.php');
require_once('simpletest/reporter.php');
require_once('../classes/log.php');

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    
    function testCreatingNewFile() {
        @unlink('/temp/test.log');
        $log = new Log('/temp/test.log');
        $this-&gt;assertFalse(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));
        $log-&gt;message('Should write this to a file');
        $this-&gt;assertTrue(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));
    }
}
<strong>
$test = &amp;new TestOfLogging();
$test-&gt;run(new HtmlReporter());</strong>
?&gt;
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                On failure the display looks like this...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>testoflogging</h1>
                    <span class="fail">Fail</span>: testcreatingnewfile-&gt;True assertion failed.<br>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: red; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>1</strong> passes and <strong>1</strong> fails.</div>
                </div>
                ...and if it passes like this...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>testoflogging</h1>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: green; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>2</strong> passes and <strong>0</strong> fails.</div>
                </div>
				And if you get this...
                <div class="demo">
                    <b>Fatal error</b>:  Failed opening required '../classes/log.php' (include_path='') in <b>/home/marcus/projects/lastcraft/tutorial_tests/Log/tests/log_test.php</b> on line <b>7</b>
                </div>
				it means you're missing the <em>classes/Log.php</em> file that could look like...
<pre>
&lt;?php
class Log {
    
        function Log($file_path) {
        }

		function message() {
		}
}
?&gt;;

            </p>
        
        <p>
<a class="target" name="group">
<h2>Building group tests</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                It is unlikely in a real application that we will only ever run
                one test case.
                This means that we need a way of grouping cases into a test
                script that can, if need be, run every test in the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first step is to strip the includes and to undo our
                previous hack...
<pre>
&lt;?php<strong>
require_once('../classes/log.php');</strong>

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    
    function testCreatingNewFile() {
        @unlink('/temp/test.log');
        $log = new Log('/temp/test.log');
        $this-&gt;assertFalse(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));
        $log-&gt;message('Should write this to a file');
        $this-&gt;assertTrue(file_exists('/temp/test.log'));<strong>
    }
}
?&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                Next we create a new file called <em>tests/all_tests.php</em>
                and insert the following code...
<pre>
<strong>&lt;?php
require_once('simpletest/unit_tester.php');
require_once('simpletest/reporter.php');

$test = &amp;new TestSuite('All tests');
$test-&gt;addTestFile('log_test.php');
$test-&gt;run(new HtmlReporter());
?&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                The method <span class="new_code">TestSuite::addTestFile()</span>
                will include the test case file and read any new classes created
                that are descended from <span class="new_code">SimpleTestCase</span>, of which
                <span class="new_code">UnitTestCase</span> is one example.
                Just the class names are stored for now, so that the test runner
                can instantiate the class when it works its way
                through your test suite.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this to work properly the test case file should not blindly include
                any other test case extensions that do not actually run tests.
                This could result in extra test cases being counted during the test
                run.
                Hardly a major problem, but to avoid this inconvenience simply add
                a <span class="new_code">SimpleTestOptions::ignore()</span> directive
                somewhere in the test case file.
                Also the test case file should not have been included
                elsewhere or no cases will be added to this group test.
                This would be a more serious error as if the test case classes are
                already loaded by PHP the <span class="new_code">TestSuite::addTestFile()</span>
                method will not detect them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To display the results it is necessary only to invoke
                <em>tests/all_tests.php</em> from the web server.
            </p>

<a class="target" name="mock">
<h2>Using mock objects</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                Let's move further into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume that our logging class is tested and completed.
                Assume also that we are testing another class that is
                required to write log messages, say a
                <span class="new_code">SessionPool</span>.
                We want to test a method that will probably end up looking
                like this...
<pre>
<strong>
class SessionPool {
    ...
    function logIn($username) {
        ...
        $this-&gt;_log-&gt;message("User $username logged in.");
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</strong>
</pre>
                In the spirit of reuse we are using our
                <span class="new_code">Log</span> class.
                A conventional test case might look like this...
<pre>
<strong>
&lt;?php
require_once('../classes/log.php');
require_once('../classes/session_pool.php');

class TestOfSessionLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    
    function setUp() {
        @unlink('/temp/test.log');
    }
    
    function tearDown() {
        @unlink('/temp/test.log');
    }
    
    function testLogInIsLogged() {
        $log = new Log('/temp/test.log');
        $session_pool = &amp;new SessionPool($log);
        $session_pool-&gt;logIn('fred');
        $messages = file('/temp/test.log');
        $this-&gt;assertEqual($messages[0], "User fred logged in.\n");
    }
}
?&gt;</strong>
</pre>
                This test case design is not all bad, but it could be improved.
                We are spending time fiddling with log files which are
                not part of our test. Worse, we have created close ties
                with the <span class="new_code">Log</span> class and
                this test.
                What if we don't use files any more, but use ths
                <em>syslog</em> library instead?
                Did you notice the extra carriage return in the message?
                Was that added by the logger?
                What if it also added a time stamp or other data?
            </p>
            <p>
                The only part that we really want to test is that a particular
                message was sent to the logger.
                We reduce coupling if we can pass in a fake logging class
                that simply records the message calls for testing, but
                takes no action.
                It would have to look exactly like our original though.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the fake object doesn't write to a file then we save on deleting
                the file before and after each test. We could save even more
                test code if the fake object would kindly run the assertion for us.
            <p>
            </p>
                Too good to be true?
                Luckily we can create such an object easily...
<pre>
&lt;?php
require_once('../classes/log.php');
require_once('../classes/session_pool.php');<strong>
Mock::generate('Log');</strong>

class TestOfSessionLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    
    function testLogInIsLogged() {<strong>
        $log = &amp;new MockLog();
        $log-&gt;expectOnce('message', array('User fred logged in.'));</strong>
        $session_pool = &amp;new SessionPool($log);
        $session_pool-&gt;logIn('fred');
    }
}
?&gt;
</pre>
                The test will be triggered when the call to
                <span class="new_code">message()</span> is invoked on the
                <span class="new_code">MockLog</span> object.
                The mock call will trigger a parameter comparison and then send the
                resulting pass or fail event to the test display.
                Wildcards can be included here too so as to prevent tests
                becoming too specific.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the mock reaches the end of the test case without the
                method being called, the <span class="new_code">expectOnce()</span>
                expectation will trigger a test failure.
                In other words the mocks can detect the absence of
                behaviour as well as the presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mock objects in the SimpleTest suite can have arbitrary
                return values set, sequences of returns, return values
                selected according to the incoming arguments, sequences of
                parameter expectations and limits on the number of times
                a method is to be invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this test to run the mock objects library must have been
                included in the test suite, say in <em>all_tests.php</em>.
            </p>
        
        <p>
<a class="target" name="web">
<h2>Web page testing</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                One of the requirements of web sites is that they produce web
                pages.
                If you are building a project top-down and you want to fully
                integrate testing along the way then you will want a way of
                automatically navigating a site and examining output for
                correctness.
                This is the job of a web tester.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web testing in SimpleTest is fairly primitive, there is
                no JavaScript for example.
                To give an idea here is a trivial example where a home
                page is fetched, from which we navigate to an "about"
                page and then test some client determined content.
