The CodeX software From Xerox aims at providing large companies with a
easy to use, cost effective and scalable platform to make global software
sharing and reuse a reality.

CodeX provides all project development teams with a series of tools that
are needed on a daily basis to produce good software (defect/task/requirements
tracking, version control, access permission, software release mechanisms,
communication channels,etc.)

Beside that CodeX also provide managers as well as all other authorized
visitors with a global view on all on-going software development activities.
Using CodeX you can maximize chances of reuse since sharing becomes completely
painless.

- login as root user
- cd into the directory where the codex_install.sh script is located
(probably /mnt/cdrom if you received the CodeX software on a CDROM)
- For a fresh CodeX installation run the installation script with ./codex_install.sh
- For an update from 2.8 to 3.0.1 please read carefully migration_30.README and follow the instructions.

This is CodeX 3.0.1

After downloading the file, read the README and INSTALL files
carefully. And get in touch with us at codex-contact@codex.xerox.com
if you have questions.


What's new in CodeX 3.0.1?

- New Document Manager
  The CodeX document manager has been completely rewritten. Now, it:
  - can host an "unlimited" hierarchy of documents
  - accepts files, wiki pages, URLs and embedded documents
  - allows deletion, move
  - enforces read/write/manage permissions, 
  - allows document versioning and history access
  - is more scalable
  - has a nice javascript-based UI with multiple views
  While new CodeX projects will immediately benefit from the new document
  manager, existing projects will need to activate the tool in the project 
  service administration page. Existing projects that had not used the 
  legacy document manager now automatically have access to the new one.

- SOAP API foundation in CodeX.
  CodeX now offers SOAP API for programmatical access to your project data.
  For the moment, only tracker access is available through this API.

- Command-line client for CodeX
  CodeX provides a command line script that allows project members to
  consult or update tracker data. The tool and its documentation is available
  from the CodeX welcome page.

- An experimental server update mechanism is now provided to CodeX administrators
  to help manage CodeX updates.

- Tracker improvement: you may now group tracker fields in 'field sets', that
  simplify tracker management and improve readability for complex trackers.
  
- Project templates: you may now create project templates with a specific configuration
  (trackers, user groups, services, etc.). 
  A project created with a specific template will inherit its configuration.

- Platform update: CodeX now runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and benefits
  from many updated packages and improved security.

Other changes:
- survey manager has been improved
- project news may now be private, i.e. only visible to project members
- tracker fields may now be bound to multiple user groups
- and many bugs fixed!
