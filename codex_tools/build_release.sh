This is CodeX 3.2.

Please read the README and INSTALL files carefully, and get in touch with us
at codex-contact@codex.xerox.com if you have questions.


What's new in CodeX 3.2?

- Distributed services: 
  CodeX now supports a distributed architecture that allows some services (files, Subversion)
  to be located on satellite servers. 
  Please read the administration guide for more details on how to setup a 
  distributed architecture.
  Also note that this feature is still experimental.

- Improved Services:
  - The interface to the File Release Manager has been rewritten to offer a
    simpler, faster and more convenient experience.
  - The Document Manager has been upgraded with new features, like the
    ability to clone folders (within a project and across projects), the 'empty'
    document type, etc.

- Web service API and Command Line Client improved.
  You may now use the CLI or the SOAP interface to access the tracker service, 
  the document manager and the file manager.

- The server update mechanism has been improved. 
  This tool is intended for CodeX administrators to help them manage CodeX updates.
  
- Project templates have been improved.
  The template mechanism now supports the document manager, forums, CVS/SVN, in 
  addition to trackers and services.

Other changes:
- the project creation interface has been improved
- new roles: Subversion admin and News admin
- support for CVS watch mode through the CodeX interface.
- embed external services in CodeX pages (service configuration)
- permissions on news.
- news promotion mechanism updated
- Subversion upgraded to version 1.4.3

and many more smaller additions and fixes.

Enjoy CodeX!
