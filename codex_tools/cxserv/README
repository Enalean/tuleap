This is a "setuid" program that allows a registered user to start a
CodeX test server.  It looks up the user name and test server directory in a
file (/etc/cxserv.conf), performs some sanity checks on the installation,
and then directly implements the start/stop/restart operations.  It is very
careful about things like buffer overruns, and ought to greatly reduce the
amount of time that anyone needs to stay as root.  I suspect that a
legitimate user of the tool could probably use it to get some level of
privileged access, but I think that an illegitimate user would have a hard
time exploiting it.

There are some debugging aids in the "debugging" subdirectory.

This program was written by Jim Mayer, jmayer@crt.xerox.com.
