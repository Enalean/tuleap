 * Use this class to hook email management in codex.
 * How to use it:
 * 1. make a link on it in src/common/mail
 * 2. customize $this->_testDir to a directory the http server you run is
 *    allowed to write
 * 3. Replace in the target code 'Mail.class.php' by 'FakeMail.class.php'
 *    and 'new Mail()' by 'new FakeMail()'
 * 4. All the mail send will be stored in $this->_testDir/maillog (one after
 *    the others)
