CodeX 3.0 Migration README file
===============================

Welcome to CodeX 3.0.1

This document explains how to upgrade from a CodeX 2.8 server on Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 3 (RHEL3), to CodeX 3.0.1 on RHEL4.

Note: If you wish to upgrade from CodeX 3.0 to CodeX 3.0.1, simply run 
migration_from_CodeX_3.0_to_CodeX_3.0.1.sh


Here is a brief summary of the process:
- backup the data of the main server, to another server
- format disks and install RHEL4
- install CodeX 3.0.1
- copy the backed-up files and DB to their new place
- run the upgrade script migration_from_CodeX_2.8_to_CodeX_3.0.1.sh ...
et voilÃ !

RedHat recommends a full re-installation of RHEL4, and not un upgrade from RHEL3
to RHEL4:
"Although upgrades are supported from Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 2.1 and 3 
by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux family, you are more likely to have a consistent
experience by backing up your data and then installing this release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4 over your previous Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation."

For this reason, the upgrade scenario for CodeX 3.0 on RHEL4 also needs a full 
re-installation of the operating system.


Now, here are the step-by-step instructions for upgrading:

* If you have custom code running in /home/httpd, make a diff patch to keep your
  specific code. 
  Since the 'SF' dir is renamed to 'src', you can convert the string on the fly 
  to simplify the merge process:
  > svn diff -c home/httpd | sed 's/SF/src/' > backup_dir/mycodex.patch

* Make a backup of your data
  Please use "tar" or a similar command that keeps the owner, group and permis-
  sions of each file.
  Ex:
    > tar cvfz backup_dir/codex.2.8.tgz /etc/codex /home /home1 /cvsroot /svnroot /var/named/codex.zone

* Make a mysql backup of the 'sourceforge' database (use mysqldump).
  Ex:
  > mysqldump -q -u sourceforge -p sourceforge >  backup_dir/codex.2.8.sql 

* Make sure all your backup files are copied on another machine!
  If you have other files on the machine, custom scripts, non-CodeX data, etc.,
  don't forget to also make a copy (look e.g. in /root, /usr/local, etc.)
  You may also want to copy specific configuration files (/etc/mail/, 
  /etc/named.conf, /var/named, /etc/httpd, /etc/my.cnf, /var/spool/cron,  etc.)
  We recommend doint a backup of the whole '/etc' directory in order to
  keep a reference of the previous configuration settings.

* Install RHEL 4.4 on your server, erasing all previous data.
  When partitionning the disk, please choose a large partition for /var/ since 
  it will contain all CodeX data (CVS, subversion, documents, files, etc.)

* Install CodeX 3.0
  Run "codex_install.sh" on the CodeX CD, and follow the instructions. 
  Please make sure that you use the same passwords, domain names, IP address, 
  etc. as on the previous installation. Modifying the machine name is not in the
  scope of this document.
  Please Configure CodeX 3.0 properly (/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, 
  /etc/codex/conf/local.inc, etc.), so that the server can be accessed with a 
  web browser.
  ***DON'T*** create new users or projects!

* Restore your backed-up data. 
  Be carefull to use a mechanism that keeps the context (owner, group, permis-
  sions of files).
  For instance, you can use "tar" or "cp -a" to preserve the context.
  Here is a detailed list of what must be restored:

  * in /etc/codex
    Restore documentation, plugins, site-content, themes and 
    CODEX_LICENSE_ACCEPTED in /etc/codex/ (DON'T COPY the conf/ directory)

      /etc/codex/documentation/*          ---> /etc/codex/documentation/
      /etc/codex/plugins/*                ---> /etc/codex/plugins/
      /etc/codex/site-content/*           ---> /etc/codex/site-content/.
      /etc/codex/themes/*                 ---> /etc/codex/themes/
      /etc/codex/CODEX_LICENSE_ACCEPTED   ---> /etc/codex/

  * from /home
    * restore /home/users
        /home/users/*       ---> /home/users/
    * restore /home/groups
        /home/groups/*      ---> /home/group/
    * Restore /home/data/wiki in /var/lib/codex/wiki
        /home/data/wiki/*   ---> /var/lib/codex/wiki/
    * restore /home/ftp in /var/lib/codex/ftp
        /home/ftp/*         ---> /var/lib/codex/ftp/
    * restore /home/log in /var/log/codex
        /home/log/* ---> /var/log/codex/.
    * You don't need to restore /home/httpd but it is time to restore your local
      modifications saved in the patch file (step 1)
        > cd /usr/share/codex; patch -p0 <  mycodex.patch
        ... then fix the potential conflicts

  * /cvsroot/ and /svnroot/ should be restored in /var/lib/codex (there is still
    a link from the '/' dir)
      /cvsroot/*  ---> /var/lib/codex/cvsroot/.
      /svnroot/*  ---> /var/lib/codex/svnroot/.

  * /etc/skel_codex may contain custom environment scripts for user home 
    directories.
    If you have created files in this directory, you can restore them.
      /etc/skel_codex/*   ---> /etc/skel_codex/.

  * /var/named/codex.zone should be restored at the same location
      /var/named/codex.zone  ---> /var/named/codex.zone
    If you wish to restore other zone files, please note that they are now in a 
    chroot jail (the codex_full.zone is now there). E.g.:
      /var/named/root.cache.save ---> /var/named/chroot/var/named/root.cache.save

  * /home/mailman/ does not exist any longer. You should copy the appropriate
    data to their new places:
      /home/mailman/lists/*               ---> /var/lib/mailman/lists/
      /home/mailman/archives/private/*    ---> /var/lib/mailman/archives/private/

 * mysql backup is now in /var/lib/codex/backup/mysql, and binary log files are
   now in /var/lib/mysql.
      E.g.:
      /cvsroot/.mysql_backup/*   ---> /var/lib/codex/backup/mysql

 * restore subversion backup in /var/lib/codex/backup/subversion
      E.g.:
      /home1/subversion_backup/* ---> /var/lib/codex/backup/subversion/

 * If you had custom scripts in /home/httpd/cgi-bin/ (except viewcvs), you can
   restore them in /var/www/cgi-bin
      /home/httpd/cgi-bin/*    --->  /var/www/cgi-bin/.

 * Restore other scripts or data (e.g. from /usr/local, /home/tools, /root, 
   /var/spool/cron, /etc/my.cnf,  etc.) if needed.

 * If you had a specific SSL certificate, you should also restore or regenerate it.

 * Last, to recover your subversion setting, you can also restore the 
   .subversion directory:
      /home/httpd/.subversion -> /home/codexadm


* Database restore from CodeX 2.8
  You need to recover the previous database:
  * backup the new database (not really needed, but who knows...)
    > mysqldump -q -u codexadm -p codex > /root/codex.3.0.empty.sql
  * Delete the new database, and create an empty one:
    > mysql -u codexadm -p
        > drop database codex;
        > create database codex;
        > exit;
  * Restore the database from CodeX 2.8
    > mysql -u codexadm -p codex < backup_dir/codex.2.8.sql
  * If MySQL complains about "Got a packet bigger than max_allowed_packet bytes",
    you should increase the value of this parameter in /etc/my.cnf (e.g. 128M).

* user/group restore.
  You should now run the xerox_crontab.sh script to create all Unix users/groups.
  Ignore errors about DNS or HTTPD if any.
    > /usr/share/codex/src/utils/xerox_crontab.sh

* Database and file migration to CodeX 3.0.1:
  Last step of the migration: run the migration_from_CodeX_2.8_to_CodeX_3.0.1.sh script from the CodeX CD.
  Ignore the message about "./mailman file exists".


You are all set!

Please verify that the DNS is running properly (check e.g. project web sites or
subversion access).
Also verify that emails and mailing lists work as expected.
In case of problem, please refer to either the DNS or Sendmail configuration 
instructions from the CodeX Installation Guide.

Enjoy CodeX 3.0.1
