reuse. CodeX has been patiently crafted by the Xerox CodeX Team and
has been constantly improved since January 2001 when the CodeX
initiative was launched internally at Xerox. CodeX offers an easy and
fully integrated access to the best in CVS, mailing lists, bug
tracking, message boards/forums, task management, site hosting,
permanent file archival, full backups, and total web-based
administration.
