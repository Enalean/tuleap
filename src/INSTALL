The CodeX software developed and maintained internally by the Xerox
CodeX Team derives from the SourceForge software version 2.0 (August
2000). The CodeX Team has since then developed many new features that
makes CodeX suitable for use in a corporate environment.

The CodeX installation Guide is available as part of the improvements
made by Xerox over the past few years.
