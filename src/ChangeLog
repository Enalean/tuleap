	made some legacy task trackers to disappear from the web menus.

	Note to site administrators: to upgrade make a cvs update on all
	top directories (SF, site-content, documentation) and add the new
	$sys_ldap_filter parameter in etc/local.inc as listed in the
	SF/etc/local.inc.dist file.

	* www/project/: showfiles.php, admin/editreleases.php,
	admin/qrs.php: Task #2755 - File release upload - avoid name
	collisions when not in the same release
	
	(see also Bug #29478)
	
	  To upload files with already used names but in any other
	package/release, the following changes are done:
	
	 1- the uploaded file is stored for download under an intermediate
	directory named pxx_ryy where xx is the package_id and yy is the
	release_id. pxx_ryy subdir is eventualy created through an
	additional fileforge command (fileforge creates one directory when
	needed). fileforge is unchanged. then, a second fileforge command
	moves filename to the pxx_ryy subdir.(editreleases.php and qrs.php)
	
	 2- pxx_ryy/filename is stored in database (no collision except if
	in same release) (editreleases.php and qrs.php)
	
	 3- only filename is shown to users. (showfiles.php)
	
	 4- download anchor uses pxx_ryy/filename path (to use the right
	stored file for download). (showfiles.php)

	CodeX customer.
	
	PHP scripts and SITE-CONTENT files
	---------------------------------- The term 'Xerox' have been
	replaced by the global variable $sys_org_name declared in the
	etc/local.inc.dist file. $sys_long_org_name has also been
	introduced to hold the long name of your company (e.g. 'Xerox' for
	$sys_org_name and 'Xerox Corporation' for $sys_long_org_name).
	
	The hardcoded distinguished name (DN) used in the LDAP search has
	been replaced by the $sys_ldap_dn global variable because it also
	refered to Xerox.
	
	**IMPORTANT NOTE** All CodeX administrators must copy the 3 global
	variables listed above from the SF/etc/local.inc.dist file to the
	/etc/local.inc file of their running system and change their value
	accordingly if need be.
	
	DOCUMENTATION ------------- The CodeX User Guide has also been made
	configurable by removing all harcoded references to Xerox like in
	the company name, the machine names, URLs containing xerox.com,
	etc...
	
	The file documentation/user/guide/xml/en_US/ParametersDefault.dtd
	contains all the entities that are used in the CodeX User Guide.
	All these entities can be redefined locally by each CodeX site in
	the ParametersLocal.dtd file which is initially empty. Never change
	the ParametersDefault.dtd file!!
	
	The CodeX Installation Guide has been updated to reflect these new
	configuration capabilities.

	* www/: bugs/bug_utils.php, pm/pm_utils.php,
	support/support_utils.php: For bug #19712.  There's a bug/feature
	in Outlook 2002/2003 that messes up the formatting of messages from
	the CodeX bug tracker. Recent versions of Outlook attempt to
	automagically unwrap text in text/plain messages. In some cases,
	such as the "Additional Follow-up Comments" line in bug tracker
	emails, outlook wraps messages from CodeX inappropriately.
	
	Here's a Microsoft support message documenting the problem and some
	work arounds:
	
	    http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=287816
	
	The listed routines were modified so that seperator lines are not
	perceived as flowable text by Outlook 2002.  This mostly consists
	of adding sequences of three spaces when there is embedded text in
	the seperator line.

2003-03-25 16:54  jmayer

	* www/account/login.php: Modified login.php in response to bug

	empty (3) either (a) the sys_force_ssl global is set (b) the
	sys_stay_in_ssl global is NOT set (c) the stay_in_ssl POST variable
	is set
	
	Note that the name of the sys_stay_in_ssl global is confusing. If

	* www/bugs/: bug_utils.php, admin/field_usage.php: Relax the

	form can be configured. Required fields (fields which must be used
	in the bug tracking system) can now be made (in)visible on the bugr
	submission form. Plus a nasty bug was corrected ($field_name was
	used instead of $field)
	
	It also means that these fields can initially have an empty value
	even if they are not allowed to have it. This is not much of a
	problem since when the bug is going to be modified the next time,
	the project member will be warned about these empty values and will
	have to fill them in. Of course if the fields in question shows up
	on the submission form the check on the empty value will be done.

	(Can't log on) and bug #17359 (Brows CVS link does not include
	configured port numbers).
	
	They make the following changes:
	
	(1) CVS URLs are generated from "sys_default_domain" instead of
	"sys_cvs_host".
	
	(2) CVS URLs to repositories now end in "/", this avoids an
	unnecessary redirection.
	
	(3) In the "cvsweb" stuff, redirections to the CodeX login page no
	longer specify the protocol to use.  This is in line with the way
	such redirections are handled from PHP.
	
	(4) A bug in "pre.php" is fixed that caused redirections to break
	if the protocol was explicitly provided (this was the direct cause
	of the problem in support request #101520).
	
	(5) Comments were added to local.inc.dist to clarify that the
	cvsweb interface always runs on the "sys_default_domain" web
	server, and that if the "sys_cvs_host" machine is different, then
	the "sys_default_domain" host must be able to remotely mount the
	cvs host's file system.

SOURCEFORGE 2.0   
	- To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge, 
	  visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at 
	  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Foundry code now present and cleaned up.
	  You can create new foundries simply by selecting that option in 
	  the /admin/groupedit.php page (Tim)

	- Theming support sitewide and html library cleanup. Sample themes 
	  included in /www/themes/ (Geoff)

	- Audit trail for projects. Now when site-admins and project-admins 
	  change a project, certain events will cause an audit trail recording 
	  (events like adding/removing users, updating permissions, etc) (Tim)

	- File release system totally rewritten from the ground up to use a 
	  more normalized database schema. There is an upgrade script in 
	  /www/admin/ which should help you migrate data from the old 
	  structure (Tim)

	- Using some classes to "objectize" things like Groups, Projects, 
	  and Foundries. Project and Foundry extend Group. See 
	  /include/Group.class /include/Foundry.class and 
	  /include/Project.class (Tim)

	- Hundreds of misc. interface cleanups sitewide. More user feedback, 
	  ordering of pop-up list boxes, submit buttons added to the tops of 
	  many forms sitewide, etc etc (Tim, Geoff, Wallace Lee)

	- Task manager can now move tasks among subprojects. (Wallace Lee)

	- Sitewide stats project. Organizing daily stats for each project 
	  into summary tables, graphing the results. (Matt Snelham)

	- Groundwork for advogato-like system of peer ratings. Need to 
	  finish user interface. New system goes beyond advogato, as each 
	  user has a unique "importance factor" and overall ranking among 
	  all users on the entire site. Only users that have achieved a 
	  "trust" level will be able to successfully rate others. See 
	  /www/admin/calculate_user_metric.php (Tim)

	- Changed user home pages to /users/*user_name*/ using .htaccess 
	  directive similar to /foundry/ and /project/ (Tim)

SOURCEFORGE 1.5.0 

        - To get help setting up your copy of SourceForge,           
          visit the "SF Offsite Talk" discussion boards at
          http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=21304

	- Added a "portability" patch. Massive thanks to 
	  William Hardeman and David HM Spector for this. SF deployers 
	  everywhere will thank them

	- Removed a lot of hard-coded references to SF.net everywhere, 
	  including hard-coded user_id's of the SF core staff

	- Wallace Lee continues to make numerous clean patches throughout 
	  the site (naming forums/subprojects/mailing lists among others)

	- Optimizations throughout the code base - added intelligence to the
	  user.php and group.php library so database queries aren't wasted. 

	- Tested under PHP4 and only one know issue was found and fixed.

	- Starting the process of database portability. Changed the keyword 
	  "public" in groups to "is_public". Changing the "user" table to 
	  "users" is next in line, but it is a HUGE task.

	- Tested some features on Postgres and found that LIMIT/OFFSET 
	  syntax is incompatible. Postgres also cannot yet handle large 
	  text fields that are > 8K in length (problem for the patch Mgr)

	- Slick new "browse" options on the bug/task/support/project mgrs

	- Changed project homepages to "/projects/*project_name*/" using 
	  the .htaccess "files" directive. This is known to be problematic 
	  on some other platforms.

	- Laid groundwork for "portals" which are half-baked and considered 
	  useless right now.

	- Project Admin page modernized
