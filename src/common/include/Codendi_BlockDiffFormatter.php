/**
 * block conflict diff formatter.
 *
 * This class will format a diff identical to Diff3 (i.e. editpage
 * conflicts), but when there are only two source files. To be used by
 * future enhancements to reloading / upgrading pgsrc.
 *
 * Functional but not finished yet, need to eliminate redundant block
 * suffixes (i.e. "=======" immediately followed by another prefix)
 * see class LoadFileConflictPageEditor
