/**
 * The NDC class implements <i>nested diagnostic contexts</i>.
 *
 * NDC was defined by Neil Harrison in the article "Patterns for Logging
 * Diagnostic Messages" part of the book <i>"Pattern Languages of
 * Program Design 3"</i> edited by Martin et al.
 *
 * A Nested Diagnostic Context, or NDC in short, is an instrument
 * to distinguish interleaved log output from different sources. Log
 * output is typically interleaved when a server handles multiple
 * clients near-simultaneously.
 *
 * This class is similar to the {@link LoggerMDC} class except that it is
 * based on a stack instead of a map.
 *
 * Interleaved log output can still be meaningful if each log entry
 * from different contexts had a distinctive stamp. This is where NDCs
 * come into play.
 *
 * <b>Note that NDCs are managed on a per thread basis</b>.
 *
 * NDC operations such as {@link push()}, {@link pop()},
 * {@link clear()}, {@link getDepth()} and {@link setMaxDepth()}
 * affect the NDC of the <i>current</i> thread only. NDCs of other
 * threads remain unaffected.
 *
 * For example, a servlet can build a per client request NDC
 * consisting the clients host name and other information contained in
 * the the request. <i>Cookies</i> are another source of distinctive
 * information. To build an NDC one uses the {@link push()}
 * operation.
 *
 * Simply put,
 *
 * - Contexts can be nested.
 * - When entering a context, call <kbd>LoggerNDC::push()</kbd>
 *   As a side effect, if there is no nested diagnostic context for the
 *   current thread, this method will create it.
 * - When leaving a context, call <kbd>LoggerNDC::pop()</kbd>
 * - <b>When exiting a thread make sure to call {@link remove()}</b>
 *
 * There is no penalty for forgetting to match each
 * <kbd>push</kbd> operation with a corresponding <kbd>pop</kbd>,
 * except the obvious mismatch between the real application context
 * and the context set in the NDC.
 *
 * If configured to do so, {@link LoggerPatternLayout} and {@link LoggerLayoutTTCC}
 * instances automatically retrieve the nested diagnostic
 * context for the current thread without any user intervention.
 * Hence, even if a servlet is serving multiple clients
 * simultaneously, the logs emanating from the same code (belonging to
 * the same category) can still be distinguished because each client
 * request will have a different NDC tag.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * {@example ../../examples/php/ndc.php 19}<br>
 *
 * With the properties file:
 *
 * {@example ../../examples/resources/ndc.properties 18}<br>
 *
 * Will result in the following (notice the conn and client ids):
 *
 * <pre>
 * 2009-09-13 19:04:27 DEBUG root conn=1234: just received a new connection in src/examples/php/ndc.php at 23
 * 2009-09-13 19:04:27 DEBUG root conn=1234 client=ab23: some more messages that can in src/examples/php/ndc.php at 25
 * 2009-09-13 19:04:27 DEBUG root conn=1234 client=ab23: now related to a client in src/examples/php/ndc.php at 26
 * 2009-09-13 19:04:27 DEBUG root : back and waiting for new connections in src/examples/php/ndc.php at 29
 * </pre>
