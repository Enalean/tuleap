/**
 * Users should extend this class to implement customized logging
 * event filtering. Note that {@link LoggerCategory} and {@link LoggerAppender},
 * the parent class of all standard
 * appenders, have built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you
 * first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
 * your own custom filters.
 *
 * <p>This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be
 * organized in a linear chain. The {@link #decide
 * decide(LoggerLoggingEvent)} method of each filter is called sequentially,
 * in the order of their addition to the chain.
 *
 * <p>The {@link decide()} method must return one
 * of the integer constants {@link LoggerFilter::DENY},
 * {@link LoggerFilter::NEUTRAL} or {@link LoggerFilter::ACCEPT}.
 *
 * <p>If the value {@link LoggerFilter::DENY} is returned, then the log event is
 * dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining
 * filters.
 *
 * <p>If the value {@link LoggerFilter::NEUTRAL} is returned, then the next filter
 * in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in the
 * chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the presence of no
 * filters, the default behaviour is to log all logging events.
 *
 * <p>If the value {@link LoggerFilter::ACCEPT} is returned, then the log
 * event is logged without consulting the remaining filters.
 *
 * <p>The philosophy of log4php filters is largely inspired from the
 * Linux ipchains.
