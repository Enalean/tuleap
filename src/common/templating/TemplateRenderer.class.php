/**
 * In order to use a template engine with src/common/mvc2/Controller.class.php
 * subclasses, one need to extend the following class.
 * 
 * For now, at least one renderer instance per plugin is needed, since
 * each plugin has its own templates directory.
 * 
 * REMAINING ISSUES:
 * 
 * - This pseudo Presenter pattern could evolve to a View one, where View classes
 *   would contain the rendering logic, so Controllers would only need to
 *   instanciate and render the View, instead of ensuring communication between
 *   Template and Presenter.
 * 
 * - There is no simple way to share templates between plugins for now.
 * 
 * - The expected Presenter object may differ with some future engines.
