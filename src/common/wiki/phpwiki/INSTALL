REQUIREMENTS

PhpWiki requires a web server with at least PHP version 4.0.6.
PhpWiki was tested 4.0.4pl1 and 4.0.5 also, but several bugs in these 
releases make them unstable for production sites.

Due to a security issue found in all versions of PHP (including 3.x
and 4.x), all users of PHP are strongly encouraged to either upgrade
to at least PHP 4.2.2, or install a patch available for PHP 3.0.18, 
4.0.6 and 4.1.0/4.1.1. Visit <http://www.php.net> for downloads and 
information. 
Larger phpwiki installations (big pages or > 500 pages) 
with PHP <= 4.3.9 suffer from a PCRE memory problem and might not 
work with the 8MB default PHP memory limit.

You need the Perl regular expressions package compiled in; this is the
default for PHP, so you probably have it. If you don't you'll see an
error like "function preg_replace() not defined."

PHP must also be compiled with support for the type of database you
want to use, i.e. --with-gdbm, --with-db2, --with-db3, --with-msql,
--with-pgsql. (With PHP4 MySQL support is always enabled. With PHP5 
sqlite instead). Consult the PHP installation manual for specific 
installation and configure options. 
<http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php>

Since version 1.3.0 PhpWiki uses the 'DB.php' from PEAR, a database
abstraction layer which is part of PHP. PhpWiki version 1.3.3 and later
includes the necessary PEAR libraries and will use it if your system 
PEAR library can not be found. For more information about PEAR 
see <http://pear.php.net/>.


QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS

Copy 'config/config-dist.ini' to 'config/config.ini' and edit the 
settings in 'config/config.ini' to your liking.

By default PhpWiki is configured to use a dba database. If there
is no dba on your system, you will see an error like this the first
time you try to use PhpWiki:
 
    "Fatal error: Call to undefined function: dba_open() in 
     phpwiki/lib/DbaDatabase.php on line 32"

To correct this you will have to check the available dba handlers 
(default: db3 for Windows, otherwise gdbm), install the dba extension 
or preferably an sql-compatible database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL 
and make the necessary configuration changes to 'lib/config/config.ini'.


INSTRUCTIONS

Below are the instructions for the "out of the box" installation,
which uses DB files. If you are using a relational database like
MySQL, see the INSTALL file for your database in the 'doc/' directory
under the root of your PhpWiki installation.


0. INSTALLATION

Untar / gzip this file into the directory where you want it to
live. That's it.

bash$ gzip -d phpwiki-X.XX.tar.gz
bash$ tar -xvf phpwiki-X.XX.tar

In the config subdirectory copy 'config-dist.ini' to 'config.ini' and 
edit the settings in 'config.ini' to your liking.


1. CONFIGURATION

The first time you run this Wiki it will load a set of basic pages
from the 'pgsrc/' directory. These should be enough to get your Wiki
started.

PhpWiki will create some DBA files in '/tmp'. They contain the pages
of the live site, archived pages, and some additional information.

If you don't want the DBA files to live in '/tmp' you must make sure
the web server can read/write to your chosen location.  It's probably
a bad idea to leave it in '/tmp', so change it in 'config/config.ini'.

WARNING: On many systems, files in '/tmp' are subject to periodic
         removal. We very strongly advise you to move the files to
         another directory.

For example, create a subdirectory called 'pages' in the 'phpwiki'
directory which was made when you untarred PhpWiki. Move the DBA files
there. The files should already have proper rights and owners, as they
were created by the web server. If not, change the permissions
accordingly so your web server can read / write the DBA files. Note
that you must be root to move files created by the web server.

Next you must ensure that the web server can access the 'pages'
directory and can create new files in it. For example, if your web
server runs as user 'nobody', give the web server access like this:

bash$ chown nobody:youraccount pages
bash$ chmod 755 pages

This is necessary so that the server can also create / set the
database lock file (PHP has a built in locking mechanism for DBA file
access).  Or if you're really lazy and don't worry much about
security:

bash$ chmod 777 pages

Note: This is insecure. The proper way is to let the directory be
      owned by the web servers GUID and give it read and write access.


2. ALLOWING EMBEDDED HTML

PhpWiki ships with this feature disabled by default. According to
CERT, malicious users can embed HTML in your pages that allow pure
evil to happen:

    <http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html>

Set the ENABLE_RAW_HTML to true in ' config/config.ini' to allow
embedded HTML, but you should NEVER do this if your Wiki is publicly
accessible!

3. ETC

Installing PHP is beyond the scope of this document :-) You should
visit <http://www.php.net/> if you don't have PHP. Note that you
should have the web server configured to allow index.php as the root
document of a directory.
