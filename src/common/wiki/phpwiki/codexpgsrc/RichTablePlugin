RichTablePlugin is a plugin that takes off from the OldStyleTablePlugin. It allows a user to specify arbitrary properties of <tt><table></tt>, <tt><tr></tt> and <tt><td></tt> with a very simple markup.

NEW: The plugin is now fixed so that the contents of each cell are individually processed by the ~BlockParser. This means that if everything works correctly,  you can do interesting things like put *invoke plugins*, use *enumerated lists* etc within each cell!

*A <tt>"-"</tt> (dash) at the start of a new line represents a new row in the table.
*A <tt>"|"</tt> (vertical bar or pipe) at the start of a new line represents a cell.
*Attributes for the tags
  *A line that starts with a <tt>"*"</tt> (star or asterisk) after a <tt>"|"</tt> is parsed for attributes for the corresponding cell.
  *Attributes for the table are given on line that starts with a <tt>"*"</tt>, only if the line appears before any other line except whitespace.
  *A line that starts with a <tt>-</tt> is always parsed for attributes since it can't have any content, unlike a cell.
*Cell contents
  *Cell contents are processed by the ~BlockParser.
  *Any line that starts with a <tt>"*"</tt> anywhere other than the table attribute line is treated as normal content.
  *Any line that starts with whitespace is also treated as content.
  *Any cell line that does not have a <tt>"*"</tt> after the <tt>"|"</tt> is treated as normal content.
  *All content lines that follow a cell line are added to that cell. They can contain arbitrary text except the above cases.
  *If there is no cell in the current row, content lines are dropped silently.
*The two special characters <tt>"~~"</tt> and <tt>"?>"</tt> should be escaped as <tt>"\~~"</tt> and <tt>"?\>"</tt>. I havn't discovered any other characters yet that might need to be escaped. This is required for the block parser to work.

Bugs:
* The source code sucks
* The plugin can't nest itself yet. Thus nested tables are currently not possible.

Example:

<?plugin RichTable

*border=1, cellpadding=5, bgcolor=#f0f8f8, width=75%, align=center
-
|* colspan=3, align=center
HomePage
-
|* colspan=2
[http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/themes/default/images/png.png]
|* rowspan=2
This cell actually has a plugin invocation inside it!
<?plugin
BackLinks
?\>
- bgcolor=white
|
#One
#Two
|
*Foo
*Bar
- bgcolor=cyan
This line gets dropped ... no cell to contain it!
|* bgcolor=#f0f0ff, align=center
One paragraph

Another paragraph?
|* align=left
This cell uses the row color
| I wish this cell had a nested table inside it! :(
?>

The above table is rendered from:

<verbatim>
<?plugin RichTable

*border=1, cellpadding=5, bgcolor=#f0f8f8, width=75%, align=center
-
|* colspan=3, align=center
HomePage
-
|* colspan=2
[http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/demo/themes/default/images/png.png]
|* rowspan=2
This cell actually has a plugin invocation inside it!
<?plugin
BackLinks
?\>
- bgcolor=white
|
#One
#Two
|
*Foo
*Bar
- bgcolor=cyan
This line gets dropped ... no cell to contain it!
|* bgcolor=#f0f0ff, align=center
One paragraph.

Another paragraph?
|* align=left
This cell uses the row color
| I wish this cell had a nested table inside it! :(
?>
</verbatim>
