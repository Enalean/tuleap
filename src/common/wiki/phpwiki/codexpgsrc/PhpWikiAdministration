_*Note:*_  _Most of the actions on this page require administrative
privileges. They will not work unless you have set an admin username and
password in the PhpWiki config file._

----
!!! Page Explorer

First select pages and then define the action:

<?plugin-form WikiAdminSelect s="*" ?>

or call the available ~WikiAdmin actions directly:

[Remove | PhpWikiAdministration/Remove] |
  [Rename | PhpWikiAdministration/Rename] |
    [Replace | PhpWikiAdministration/Replace]
      

----
!!! Cleanup

A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to
pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc.

  [Rake the SandBox|phpwiki:?action=loadfile&source=pgsrc/SandBox].

----------

!!! Making Snapshots or Backups

!! ZIP files of database

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the pages in your Wiki. The zip file will be downloaded to your local
computer.

  This *[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=zip]* contains only the
  latest versions of each page, while this *[ZIP Dump |
  phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all]* contains all archived versions.

  (If the PhpWiki is configured to allow it, anyone can download a zip
  file.)

If your php has _zlib_ support, the files in the archive will be
compressed, otherwise they will just be stored.

!! Dump to directory

Here you can dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your choice.

  <?plugin WikiForm action=dumpserial?>

The most recent version of each page will written out to the
directory, one page per file. Your server must have write permissions
to the directory!

----

!!! Dump pages as XHTML

  <?plugin WikiForm action=dumphtml?>

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for
distribution on disk where no web server is available. The various
links for page editing functions and navigation are removed from the
pages.

  The XHTML file collection can also be downloaded as an
  *[XHTML ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=ziphtml]*.

----

!!! Phpwiki Internals

These are here mostly for debugging purposes (at least, that is the
hope.)

In normal use, you should not need to use these, though, then again,
they should not really do any harm.

!! Purge Markup Cache

(If your wiki is so configured,) the transformed (almost-HTML) content
of the most recent version of each page is cached. This speeds up page
rendering since parsing of the wiki-text takes a fair amount of juice.

  Hitting this button will delete all cached transformed
  content. (Each pages content will be transformed and re-cached next
  time someone views it.)

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-cache
           label="Purge Cache"
   ?>

!! Clean WikiDB of Illegal Filenames

Page names beginning with the subpage-separator, usually a slash
(=/=), are not allowed. Sometimes though an errant plugin or something
might create one....

  This button will delete any pages with illegal page names, without possibility to restore.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-bad-pagenames
           label="Purge bad pagenames"
   ?>

!! Clean WikiDB of empty and unreferenced pages

  *Warning!* This button will delete every empty and unreferenced page, without any possibility to restore them again.
  This will disable the possibility to revert or get back any deleted page.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-empty-pages
           label="Purge all empty unreferenced pages"
   ?>
