----
!!! Page Explorer

First select pages and then define the action:

<?plugin-form WikiAdminSelect s="*" ?>

or call the available ~WikiAdmin actions directly:

[/Remove] |
  [/Rename] |
    [/Replace] |
      [/SetAcl] |
        [/Chmod] |
          [/Chown]

----
!!! User Management

PhpWiki:EmailVerification is currently non-strict, leaving some possible holes, which can be 
administrated below.

  This button will show a list of all users with registered emails and buttons to set the 
  verification status manually.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=email-verification
           label="Email Verification"
   ?>

To prevent from robots eating all possible ressources in a short time, blocking from certain IPs 
or not-well-behaving user agents can be defined below. See PhpWiki:HowToBlockRobots and 
MeatBall:SurgeProtector. _Note: Not yet enabled._

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=access-restrictions
           label="Access Restrictions"
   ?>

!!! Cleanup

A Wiki SandBox is very easy to clean. Here you can restore it to
pristine condition by loading the default from pgsrc.

  [Rake the SandBox|phpwiki:?action=loadfile&source=pgsrc/SandBox].

----------

!!! Making Snapshots or Backups

!! ZIP files of database

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain all
the pages in your Wiki. The zip file will be downloaded to your local
computer.

  This *[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=zip]* contains only the
  latest versions of each page, while this *[ZIP Dump |
  phpwiki:?action=zip&include=all]* contains all archived versions.

  (If the PhpWiki is configured to allow it, anyone can download a zip
  file.)

If your php has _zlib_ support, the files in the archive will be
compressed, otherwise they will just be stored.

-----------
!!! Restoring

If you have dumped a set of pages from PhpWiki, you can reload them
here. Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if
you dumped your HomePage when you load it from this form it will
overwrite the one in your database now. If you want to be selective
just delete the pages from the directory (or zip file) which you don't
want to load.

!! Upload File

Here you can upload ZIP archives, or individual files from your
(client) machine.

  <?plugin WikiForm action=upload?>

!! Upgrade

Do some verification checks and upgrade changes automatically, after having installed a 
new phpwiki engine update:
* Upgrade new or changed page revisions from pgsrc,
* Upgrade the database schema (mysql _page.id auto_increment_, ADD _session.sess_ip_),

;:[ Upgrade | phpwiki:HomePage?action=upgrade ]

-----------

!!! Format of the files

Currently the pages are stored, one per file, as MIME (RFC:2045)
e-mail (RFC:822) messages. The content-type _application/x-phpwiki_
is used, and page meta-data is encoded in the content-type
parameters. (If the file contains several versions of a page, it will
have type _multipart/mixed_, and contain several sub-parts, each
with type _application/x-phpwiki_.)  The message body contains the
page text.

!! Old Formats

*Serialized Files*

  The dump to directory command used to dump the pages as PHP
  _serialized()_ strings. For humans, this made the files very hard
  to read, and nearly impossible to edit.

*Plain Files*

  Before that the page text was just dumped to a file--this means that
  all page meta-data was lost. Note that when loading _plain files_,
  the page name is deduced from the file name.

The upload and load functions will automatically recognize each of
these three types of files, and handle them accordingly.

----

!!! Dump pages as XHTML

This will generate a directory of static pages suitable for
distribution on disk where no web server is available. The various
links for page editing functions and navigation are removed from the
pages.

  The XHTML file collection can be downloaded as an
  *[XHTML ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?action=ziphtml]*.

----

!!! Phpwiki Internals

These are here mostly for debugging purposes (at least, that is the
hope.)

In normal use, you should not need to use these, though, then again,
they should not really do any harm.

!! Purge Markup Cache

(If your wiki is so configured,) the transformed (almost-HTML) content
of the most recent version of each page is cached. This speeds up page
rendering since parsing of the wiki-text takes a fair amount of juice.

  Hitting this button will delete all cached transformed
  content. (Each pages content will be transformed and re-cached next
  time someone views it.)

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-cache
           label="Purge Cache"
   ?>

!! Clean WikiDB of Illegal Filenames

Page names beginning with the subpage-separator, usually a slash
(=/=), are not allowed. Sometimes though an errant plugin or something
might create one....

  This button will delete any pages with illegal page names, without possibility to restore.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-bad-pagenames
           label="Purge bad pagenames"
   ?>

!! Clean WikiDB of empty and unreferenced pages

  *Warning!* This button will delete every empty and unreferenced page, without any possibility to restore them again.
  This will disable the possibility to revert or get back any deleted page.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=purge-empty-pages
           label="Purge all empty unreferenced pages"
   ?>

!! Convert cached_html to new SQL column

  This is only needed on SQL or ADODB if you didn't do action=upgrade, but created the 
  new page.cached_html field seperately, and now you want to move this data from 
  page.pagedata over to page.cached_html.

  <?plugin WikiAdminUtils
           action=convert-cached-html
           label="Convert cached_html"
   ?>
