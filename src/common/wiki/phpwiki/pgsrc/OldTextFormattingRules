! Synopsis
OldTextFormattingRules%%%
__Emphasis:__ '____' for ''italics'', _''''_ for __bold__, '____'_''''_ for ''__both__''.%%%
__Lists:__ * for bullet lists, # for numbered lists, ''__;__ term __:__ definition'' for definition lists.%%%
__References:__ !JoinCapitalizedWords or use square brackets for a [[page link] or URL [[!http://cool.wiki.int/].%%%
__Footnotes:__ Use [[1],[[2],[[3],...%%%
__Preventing linking:__ Prefix with "!": !!DoNotHyperlink, name links like [[[[text | URL] (double up on the "[").%%%
__Misc:__ "!", "!!", "!!!" make headings, "%%''''%" makes a linebreak, "-''''-''''-''''-" makes a horizontal rule.
__Tables:__ »|« as first char, »|« for more columns, »|>« align right, »|<« align left, »|^« centered (default), »||« span columns, »|v« span rows

----
! Paragraphs

* Don't indent paragraphs
* Words wrap and fill as needed
* Use blank lines as separators
* Four or more minus signs make a horizontal rule
* %%''''% makes a linebreak (in headings and lists too)


! Lists

* asterisk for first level
** asterisk-asterisk for second level, etc.
* Use * for bullet lists, # for numbered lists (mix at will)
* semicolon-term-colon-definition for definition lists:
;term here:definition here, as in the <DL><DT><DD> list
* One line for each item
* Other leading whitespace signals preformatted text, changes font.

! Headings

* '!' at the start of a line makes a small heading
* '!!' at the start of a line makes a medium heading
* '!!!' at the start of a line makes a large heading

! Fonts

* Indent with one or more spaces to use a monospace font:

 This is in monospace
This is not

!Indented Paragraphs

* semicolon-colon -- works like <BLOCKQUOTE>

;: this is an indented block of text

! Emphasis

* Use doubled single-quotes ('____') for emphasis (usually ''italics'')
* Use doubled underscores (_''''_) for strong emphasis (usually __bold__)
* Mix them at will: __''bold italics''__
* ''Emphasis'' can be used ''multiple'' times within a line, but ''cannot'' cross line boundaries:

''this
will not work''

! References
* Hyperlinks to other pages within the Wiki are made by placing the page name in square brackets: [this is a page link] or UsingWikiWords (preferred)
* Hyperlinks to external pages are done like this: [http://www.wcsb.org/]
* You can name the links by providing a name, a bar (|) and then the hyperlink or pagename: [PhpWiki home page | http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/]  - [the front page | HomePage]
* You can suppress linking to old-style references and URIs by preceding the word with a '!', e.g. !NotLinkedAsWikiName, !http://not.linked.to/
* You can create footnotes by using [[1], [[2], [[3], ... like this here [1]. See footnote for counterpart.  (If the [[ is in the first column, it is a footnote ''definition'' rather than a footnote ''reference'' [1].)
* Also, the old way of linking URL's is still supported: precede URLs with "http:", "ftp:" or "mailto:" to create links automatically as in: http://c2.com/
* URLs ending with .png, .gif, or .jpg are inlined if in square brackets, by themselves.

! Tables

* Simple tables are available.  A table row is introduced by a __|__ in the first column.  It is best described by example:
      ||  _''''_Name_''''_               |v _''''_Cost_''''_   |v _''''_Notes_''''_
      | _''''_First_''''_   | _''''_Last_''''_
      |> Jeff       |< Dairiki   |^  Cheap     |< Not worth it
      |> Marco      |< Polo      | Cheaper     |< Not available
;: will generate
||  __Name__               |v __Cost__   |v __Notes__
| __First__   | __Last__
|> Jeff       |< Dairiki   |^  Cheap     |< Not worth it
|> Marco      |< Polo      | Cheaper     |< Not available

;: Note that multiple __|__'s lead to spanned columns, and __v__'s can be used to span rows.  A __>__ generates a right justified column, __<__ a left justified column and __^__ a centered column (which is the default.)
;: With the new TextFormatingsRules tables are only supported with the OldStyleTablePlugin.


! HTML Mark-Up Language

* Don't bother
* < and > are themselves
* The & characters will not work
* If you really must use HTML, your system administrator can enable this feature. Start each line with a bar (|). Note that this feature is disabled by default.

! More detail than you want to know

See [MagicPhpWikiURLs] for gory details on how to write various kind of wiki maintainance links. (''deprecated'')

-----

! Footnotes:

[1] By using [[1] a second time (in the first column) the footnote itself is ''defined''.  You may refer to a footnote as many times as you want, but you may only define it once on the page.  Note the the [[1] in the footnote links back to the first reference, if there are multiple references there will be +'s after the [[1] which will link to the other references.  (References which come ''after'' the footnote ''definition'' will not be linked to.)
