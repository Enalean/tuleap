Installing phpwiki with MySQL 
-----------------------------

This assumes that you have a working MySQL server and client setup.
Installing MySQL is beyond the scope of this document.
For more information on MySQL go to http://www.mysql.org/

1. If you do not have a suitable database already, create one (using
   the root or other privileged account you set up when MySQL was
   installed.)

	mysqladmin -uuser -ppassword create phpwiki

2. If necessary create a user for that database which has the rights
   to select, insert, update, delete (again using the root
   administration account).

	mysql -uuser -ppassword phpwiki

   A MySQL grant statement for this user would look like this:

	GRANT select, insert, update, delete, lock tables 
	ON phpwiki.*
	TO wikiuser@localhost
	IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

	Upgrade note: The mysql wikiuser needs to have the LOCK TABLES
	privilege granted for all the wiki tables (PAGE, VERSION,
	LINK, RECENT and NONEMPTY). This is a relatively new privilege type.

3. Create tables inside your database (still using the root account).

	mysql -uuser -ppassword phpwiki < schemas/mysql.sql

   Note: the user specified in this command needs to have the rights
         to drop and create tables. Use the same user as in step 1.

   If you are using MySQL 3.21.x or earlier the script may issue an
   error. In that case remove existing tables manually and delete
   the "drop tables" lines from schemas/mysql.sql - it should work now

4. Edit $DBParams in index.php to reflect your settings.

	a) $DBParams['dbtype'] should be set to 'SQL'.
	b) $DBParams['dsn'] should be set to something like
           'mysql://username:password@host/phpwiki'.
	   (where 'phpwiki' is the mysql database name.)
        c) Note that if you set $DBParams['prefix'] to a 
           non-empty string, you will have to edit
           schemas/mysql.sql before you perform step
           three (above).  (Sorry.)

That's it. phpwiki should now work.

If you run into problems then check that your MySQL-user has
the necessary access rights for the phpwiki tables.

Hint for Linux-Debian users: it may be necessary to load the MySQL
module first: insert the following line in config.php before
"mysql.php" gets included:
if (!extension_loaded("mysql"))  { dl("mysql.so"); }
