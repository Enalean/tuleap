 * Contains the global cache configuration settings.
 * 
 * @param 'database'        string Chooses the database used by the Pear
 *                          Cache class. Should always be set to 'file' 
 *                          for this is the fastest.
 * @param 'cache_dir'       string path to use for a file cache. 
 *                          This is only used if database is set to file.
 * @param 'filename_prefix' string Every file name in the cache
 *                          begins with this prefix. 
 * @param 'highwater'       int the maximum total space in bytes of
 *                          all files in the cache. When highwater is 
 *                          exceeded, a garbage collection will start.
 *                          It will collect garbage till 'lowwater' is 
 *                          reached. 
 * @param 'lowwater'        int Stop garbage collection as soon as less than
 *                          'lowwater' bytes are used by the cache.
 * @param 'maxlifetime'     int time in seconds a cache object is allowed
 *                          not to be touched without beeing garbage collected
 * @param 'cache_url'       string URL used to call an image from the
 *                          cache. By default this is 
 *                          'url/to/wiki/getimg.php?' where 'getimg.php'
 *                          replaces 'index.php' or 'wiki.php', respectively. 
 *                          If you do not have a 'getimg.php' you can 
 *                          create it by copying your 'wiki.php'
 *                          ('index.php') to 'getimg.php' and replace
 *                          <code>include "lib/main.php"; </code>
 *                          (to be found at the end of the file) by 
 *                          <code>include "lib/imagecache.php"; </code>. 
 *                          <b>Make sure that there is a trailing
 *                          question mark in 'cache_url'.</b>
 * @param 'maxarglen'       int number of characters allowed to be send as 
 *                          parameters in the url before using sessions
 *                          vars instead. 
 * @param 'usecache'        boolean switches the use of the cache on (true)
 *                          or off (false). If you want to avoid the
 *                          usage of a cache but need WikiPlugin~s
 *                          that nevertheless rely on a cache you might set
 *                          'usecache' to false. You still need to set
 *                          'cache_dir' appropriately to allow image creation
 *                          and you should set 'force_syncmap' to false.
 * @param 'force_syncmap'   boolean Will prevent image creation for an image 
 *                          map 'on demand'. It is a good idea to set this
 *                          to 'true' because it will also prevent the 
 *                          html part not to fit to the image of the map.
 *                          If you don't use a cache, you have to set it
 *                          to 'false', maps will not work otherwise but
 *                          strange  effects may happen if the output of
 *                          an image map producing WikiPlugin is not 
 *                          completely determined by its parameters.
 *                          (As it is the case for a graphical site map.)
