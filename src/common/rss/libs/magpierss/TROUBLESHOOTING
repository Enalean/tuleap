*************************************************************************
1.	Fatal error: Failed opening required '/path/to/script/rss_fetch.inc' 
	(include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php/pear') 
	
	This could mean that:
	
	a) PHP can't find the MagpieRSS files.
	b) PHP found them the MagpieRSS files, but can't read them.
	
	a. Telling PHP where to look for MagpieRSS file.
	
	This might mean your PHP program can't find the MagpieRSS libraries. 
	Magpie relies on 4 include files, rss_fetch.inc, rss_parse.inc,
	rss_cache.inc, rss_util.inc, and for normal use you'll need all 4 (see the
	cookbook for exceptions).

	This can be fixed by making sure the MagpieRSS files are in your include
	path.
	
	If you can edit your include path (for example your on a shared host) then
	you need to replace:
	
	require_once('rss_fetch.inc');
		
	-with-
		
	define('MAGPIE_DIR', '/path/to/magpierss/');
	require_once(MAGPIE_DIR.'rss_fetch.inc');

	b.  PHP can't read the MagpieRSS files
	
	All PHP libraries need to be readable by your webserver.
	
	On Unix you can accomplish this with:
	
	chmod 755 rss_fetch.inc rss_parse.inc rss_cache.inc rss_util.inc
	
*************************************************************************
2. Cache couldn't make dir './cache'.

	MagpieRSS caches the results of fetched and parsed RSS to reduce the load on
	both your server, and the remote server providing the RSS.  It does this by
	writing files to a cache directory.

	This error means the webserver doesn't have write access to the current
	directory.
	
	a. Make a webserver writeable cache directory
	
	Find the webserver's group. (on my system it is 'www')
	
	mkdir ./cache
	chgrp www directory_name
	chmod g+w directory_name
	
	(this is the best, and desired solution)
	
	b. Tell MagpieRSS to create the cache directory somewhere the webserver can
	write to.
	
	define('MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR', '/tmp/magpierss');

	(this is not a great solution, and might have security considerations)
		
	c. Turn off cacheing.  
	
	Magpie can work fine with cacheing, but it will be slower, and you might
	become a nuiance to the RSS provider, but it is an option.
	
	define('MAGPIE_CACHE_ON', 0);
	
	d. And lastly, do NOT
	
	chmod 777 ./cache
	
	Any of the above solutions are better then this.

	NOTE: If none of this works for you, let me know.  I've got root, and a
	custom compiled Apache on almost any box I ever touch, so I can be a little
	out of touch with reality.  But I won't know that if I don't feedback.

	-or-
	
	Fatal error: Failed to create an instance of PHP's XML parser.
	http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.xml.php
	
	Make sure your PHP was built with --with-xml
	
	This has been turned on by default for several versions of PHP, but it might
	be turned off in your build.
	
	See php.net for details on building and configuring PHP.

4.	Warning: MagpieRSS: Failed to fetch index.rdf. 
	(HTTP Error: Invalid protocol "")
	
	You need to put http:// in front of your the URL to your RSS feed

*************************************************************************	
5.	Warning: MagpieRSS: Failed to parse RSS file. 
	(not well-formed (invalid token) at line 19, column 98)

	There is a problem with the RSS feed you are trying to read. 
	MagpieRSS is an XML parser, and therefore can't parse RSS feed with invalid
	characters.  Some RSS parser are based on regular expressions, and can
	parse invalid RSS but they have their own problems.

	You could try contacting the author of the RSS feed, and pointing them to
	the online RSS validator at:
	
	http://feeds.archive.org/validator/

*************************************************************************	
6.	Warning: MagpieRSS: Failed to fetch http://example.com/index.rdf 
	(HTTP Response: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found)

	Its a 404!  The RSS file ain't there.
