// Check that another instance of this script is not already running

// This script stores its process ID in /var/run/codendi_process_events.pid,
// and deletes it when it has finished.
// If the PID file already exists, it means either that an instance is currently
// running, or that a previous call to this script failed (and thus did not delete 
// the PID file). In this case, we send a signal to the process which PID is 
// in the file. If it returns TRUE, it means that there is a process
// with this PID running. Then, we check that the command running with this PID 
// contains the name of this script (process_system_events.php). In this case,
// we simply exit.
