# ------------------  EDIT THE CORRECT FILE  -------------------------
#
# This file is copied to /etc/cron.d/codendi from
# /usr/share/codendi/src/utils/cron.d/codendi when the codendi service is started via its
# init.d script and the file /etc/cron.d/codendi is removed when the
# service is stopped.  Therefore any edits made directly to
# /etc/cron.d/codendi will be lost anytime the codendi service
# restarts.
#
# To make changes edit the master copy /usr/share/codendi/src/utils/cron.d/codendi and then
# restart the service to pick up the changes (/sbin/service codendi restart).
#
# The reason this is done this way is because the codendi cron jobs
# should only be invoked if the codendi service is enabled and not
# just as a consequence of installing the rpm as was the case
# previously. The file /etc/cron.d/codendi cannot simply be linked to
# the master copy in /usr/share/codendi/src/utils/cron.d/codendi because for security reasons cron
# will not process crontab files that are links or writeable by
# anybody else but root, thus the file must be copied into /etc/cron.d
# with the right ownership and permissions.
