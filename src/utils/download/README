stats_ftp_logparse.pl
---------------------
Parse daily log files of the FTP daemon (they are in
$codex_log). Normally all downloads go through PHP now so there is
nothing in the log but we keep it in case we reactivate ftp downloads
some day.

Input: ftp daemon daily log file
Output: stats_ftp_downloads table


stats_http_logparse.pl
---------------------
Parse daily log files of the HTTP daemon (they are in
$codex_log). Normally all downloads go through PHP now so there is
nothing in the log but we keep it in case we reactivate ftp downloads
some day.

Input: http daemon daily log file
Output: stats_http_downloads table


stats_agr_filerelease.pl
------------------------
Aggregates downloads of released file and generate the total number of
downloads by group (project) for all times
(frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg) and by file release for all times as well
(frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg)

Input: filedownload_log table
Output: frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg, frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg tables


stats_nightly_filerelease.pl
----------------------------
Aggregates downloads of released file and generate the total number of
downloads per day by group (project) (frs_dlstats_group_agg) and by
file release per day as well (frs_dlstats_file_agg)

Input: filedownload_log table
Output:  frs_dlstats_group_agg, frs_dlstats_file_agg tables


db_dlstats_grouptotal.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
------------------------
Sum downloads by group and by day and aggregate them into the global
table. It is somehow similar to stats_agr_filerelease.pl combined with
stats_nightly_filerelease.pl but the input is from other DB tables. It
should give exactly the same result.

Input:  frs_dlstats_group_agg table
Output: frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg table

db_dlstats_filetotal.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
-----------------------
Same as above but this time it counts the number of downloads by CodeX released file. SAm observation as above
Input:  frs_dlstats_file_agg table
Output: frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg table
(** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)

db_dlstats_allagg.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
--------------------
Rescan all HTTP log files from the log dir ($codex_log) and recompute the total number of HTTP downloads for each file release and for each day
Input: HTTP log files
Output: frs_dlstats_agg


db_dlstats_grp.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
-----------------
Recompute the number of downloads of released file for all days from the frs_dlstats_agg and store it into frs_dlstats_group_agg. It is equivalent to stats_nightly_filerelease.pl but it does it for all log file at once. It is a way of regenerating
Input: frs_dlstats_agg
Output: frs_dlstats_group_agg

remission_filemaint.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
----------------------
Never looked into it.

download_filemaint.pl (** NOT USED AND OUTDATED **)
----------------------
Seems to do some clean up in the FTP release space. Would probably be
good to look into it and reactivate it.
