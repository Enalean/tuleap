# We used to install the mailman cron jobs when the mailman rpm was
# installed, irrespective of whether mailman was actually being
# run. Although the cron jobs didn't create any problems if someone
# wasn't running mailman some users complained about the cron log file
# filling up, resource usage, and power consumption since systems
# wouldn't really idle. It really only makes sense to run the mailman
# cron jobs if the mailman service is turned on and not just merely
# having the rpm installed. This init.d script is an obvious place to
# install or remove the cron jobs based on the service being enabled
# or not.
