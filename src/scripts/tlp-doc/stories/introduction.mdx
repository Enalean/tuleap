# Welcome to Tuleap design system guide

## How to use it ?

Choose a component in the navigation on the left. You will see an example of the component, and you can use controls to customize it to suit your needs.
You will also see some variations of the component with explanations. Click on the "Show code" button on the bottom right to see the corresponding HTML.
When TypeScript code is needed, the docs will show it as a code block below the component. You can also choose the color theme and the background color
for all components at the top of the screen.
