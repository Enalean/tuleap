# Layout

<code>.tlp-framed</code> and <code>.tlp-centered</code>

By default, there are no margins on the main container; this allows you to be able to use the full width of the viewport (for example when you use tabs).
However, most of the time you will need to add some margins (for example when you use panes). This is achieved by using <code>.tlp-framed</code>

<Canvas of={LayoutStories.Layout}></Canvas>
