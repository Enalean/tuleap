# Arrows

Arrows are used in roadmap or in cross tracker search to display links between artifacts.

There are 4 methods that provide the SVG path to draw an arrow:

* `getDownRightArrow()`
* `getDownLeftArrow()`
* `getUpRightArrow()`
* `getUpLeftArrow()`

The returned value of each method is a string like `"M17 17 L25 17 Q33 17, […] L54 82"` that can be given as `d` attribute of `path` element:

```svg
<path
  stroke-width="1.5px"
  stroke-linejoin="round"
  stroke-linecap="round"
  fill="none"
  stroke="#1593c4"
  d="M17 17 L25 17 Q33 17, 33 25 L33 69 Q33 77, 41 77 L59 77 L54 72 M59 77 L54 82"
/>
```

This will give the following:

<svg height="94" width="76">
    <path stroke-width="1.5px" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-linecap="round" fill="none" stroke="#1593c4" d="M17 17 L25 17 Q33 17, 33 25 L33 69 Q33 77, 41 77
    L59 77
    L54 72
    M59 77
    L54 82"></path>
</svg>

Below is a showcase of arrows with containers in different width to see how it fits well.
It is useful to check that everything is still smooth if we need to change the computation constant (gap, radius, …).
