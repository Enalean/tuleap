# Mod_perl incorporates a Perl interpreter into the Apache web server,
# so that the Apache web server can directly execute Perl code.
# Mod_perl links the Perl runtime library into the Apache web server
# and provides an object-oriented Perl interface for Apache's C
# language API.  The end result is a quicker CGI script turnaround
# process, since no external Perl interpreter has to be started.
#
LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so

# Uncomment this line to globally enable warnings, which will be
# written to the server's error log.  Warnings should be enabled
# during the development process, but should be disabled on a
# production server as they affect performance.

# Uncomment this line to enable taint checking globally.  When Perl is
# running in taint mode various checks are performed to reduce the
# risk of insecure data being passed to a subshell or being used to
# modify the filesystem.  Unfortunately many Perl modules are not
# taint-safe, so you should exercise care before enabling it on a
# production server.

#PerlSwitches -T

# This will allow execution of mod_perl to compile your scripts to
# subroutines which it will execute directly, avoiding the costly
# compile process for most requests.
