      <title>Source Code Release: Guidelines</title>

      <para>There are 2 ways by which project administrators can
      provide access to their project source code on CodeX: the
      software configuration management repository (CVS or Subversion)
      and the File Release mechanism. At first glance, having two
      distinct CodeX services seems redundant. However both have been
      developed with different objectives and target audience in mind
      and they are very much complementary. Providing both is
      definitely a plus for your visitors.</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">

          <para><emphasis role="bold">The SCM repository</emphasis>
          provides a full access to your source code including its
          entire version history. However accessing the source code
          via SCM tools requires that the CodeX user installs specific
          software on his machine. Not everybody is capable or willing
          to do so. SCM access is well suited for CodeX users who want
          to get deeper in the project code, add some new extensions,
          fix bugs and contribute changes back to the project
          team. Please be awre that certain projects decide to
          restrict the access to the SCM to project members
          only. Hence the importance of the file release
          mechanism.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">The File Release
          mechanism</emphasis> allows you to deliver pre-packaged
          version of the source code and/or binaries in one or several
          archive file (zip, tar, jar,...) that an authorized user can
          easily download from the CodeX Web site. No specific tools
          or knowledge is required. Besides possibly providing
          pre-packaged source code it is also considered a very good
          practice to provide ready-to-use binary version of your
          software to make developers life even easier.  The File
          Release service is well suited for people who want to start
          using your software without any further delay.</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>As you can see both services are fundamentally different in nature
      and we strongly encourage project teams to use both of them. In order to
      help project teams understand why these two services are highly
      complementary a typical project life cycle is documented on <xref

      <para>Before we get further into the description of the File Release
      service let&#39;s review the terms used throughout this section. These
      terms are key for the understanding of the File Release mechanism both
      for users and administrators (see <xref
      linkend="FigureTheFileReleaseStructure" />).</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Packages</emphasis> :These are the
          topmost entities visible in the File Release service. A package is a
          container for one or several Releases. In general a package do
          correspond with high-level deliverables of your software products.
          Let&#39;s assume that your team is working on a database engine.
          Possible packages could be DB-engine for the database engine itself
          and DB-drivers for the database drivers like ODBC or JDBC drivers. A
          third package DB-Docs could also be created to deliver the
          documentation in a separate container.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Releases</emphasis>: A release is a
          collection of individual files that were all frozen and time stamped
          at a given moment in time. In that sense it is also a container like
          a package but one level below. The files contained in a release
          generally correspond to a given version (also called release) of
          your software. Building on the database example above we could
          imagine than the DB-engine package has release 1.0, release 1.1 and
          release 2.0beta available. DB-drivers could have release 1.0 as well
          but no release 1.2 because the 1.0 drivers also work with the
          release 1.2 of DB-engine. In other words release naming can be
          completely independent from one package to another.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Files</emphasis>: files are the basic
          entities that one can find in a release. Again building on the
          database engine example, we can imagine that the release 1.0 of
          package DB-engine contains the file db-engine-src-1.0.zip for the
          source file and db-engine-win32-1.0.zip for the pre-compiled Windows
          version. When release 1.2 of the DB-engine package pops up, we could
          have files db-engine-src- 1.2.zip for the source file and
          db-engine-win32-1.2.zip for the pre-compiled Windows version and a
          new file called db-engine-linux-intel-1.2.zip for the pre-compiled
          Linux version running on Intel hardware. We haven&#39;t said a word
          about the DB-docs package. May be it is still empty for the moment
          ;-)</para>

      <note><para>At first glance, this structure may appear a bit
      complex. However this is really the kind of structure a project team
      should aim at to make their deliverables easy to understand and easy to
      access for the community. Thinking about the structure of your
      software and documentation deliverables ahead of time can help you
      structure your team, your working processes (e.g. build and test
      process) in the right way. Do not overlook this part of your project.</para></note>

      <title>File Release Browsing and Download</title>

      <para>The latest version of each project package (if any) is always
      visible on the Project Summary page (see <xref
      linkend="FigureASampleProjectSummaryPage" />). The latest version can
      immediately be downloaded by clicking on the &#34;Download&#34; link or visit the
      complete list of packages and release by clicking on the &#34;[View ALL
      project files]&#34; link.</para>

      <para>The first example given on <xref
      linkend="FigureTheFileReleaseScreenOfTheDataGlyphToolkitProject" />
      shows the File Release screen of the DataGlyph Toolkit project. This
      project only has one package called &#34;Xerox DataGlyph Toolkit&#34;
      with 5 releases in it from 3.0.5 to 3.1.0beta2 listed in chronological
      order. Each release contains an archive for the source code and another
      one with pre-compiled binaries (Java byte code here). Starting at release
      3.0.6 new files handling license key issues have been added.</para>

      <para>The second example comes from the Global Solutions Architecture
      project. The File Release structure is different from the previous one.
      The project has 2 separate packages: one for the GSA Toolkit and a
      second one for the DataBus. Clearly the release-numbering schemes for
      these 2 packages are completely independent. It is very likely that
      DataBus release 0.5 works with the 3 Toolkit releases names Awk, Booby
      and Condor (releases doesn&#39;t need to be numbers). In the second
      release of the Toolkit package the documentation was delivered as a
      separate file.</para>

      <title>File Release Delivery</title>

      <para>This section is for project members only. It goes through a
      detailed explanation of the File Release delivery process. This is a
      3-step process:</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Package Creation</emphasis>: Create one
          or several packages. This must only be done once. When packages are
          in place you can add a new release in them at any time.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Release Creation</emphasis>: Once a
          package has been created, you can add releases to it</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Release Configuration and Validation</emphasis>:
          When a release has been created you can use it to attach files to
          it, give it a release date, list the changes made in this release,
          etc.</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>Additionally, you may also set specific access permissions to a package or an individual release.
      </para>

      <section id="PackageCreation">
        <title>Package Creation</title>

        <para>To create a package first go to the File Release
        delivery screen. To this end , either visit your Project
        Administration page and select the &#34;[Edit/Add File
        Release...] &#34; link in the lower right corner of the
        screen, or visit the &#34;Files&#34; service from the project
        menu bar and select the &#34;Administration&#34; link in the
        File Release menu.</para>

        <para>The first time you enter this page no package is
        available.  Adding new packages is as easy as typing the
        package name in the blank field at the bottom of the screen as
        wellas a rank number to define its position on the screen and
        push on the &#34;Create This package&#34; button. Once a
        package has been created you can modify its name and status. A
        package is either active, which means that it is visible to
        the CodeX users in the File Release service and in the Project
        Summary Page, or Hidden, which means that it is only visible
        to the File Release Administrators.  Switching the status from
        Active to Hidden doesn&#39;t delete any attached releases and
        files.</para>

         <para>Please note that packages with a smaller rank number
         are displayed first.</para>

        <para>Whenever you update the name, the rank,  or the status don&#39;t forget to
        push on the &#34;Update&#34; button!</para>

        <para>The next screen is similar in spirit with Package Administration
        screen but this one deals with releases. The Release Administration
        screen allows you to create a new release by typing a name (with
        letters, numbers, punctuation symbols...) in the blank field at the
        bottom of the screen. You also have a last chance to assign this new
        release to the appropriate package by selecting the package name in
        the package menu box next to it. Then Click on the &#34;Create This
        Release&#34; button.</para>

        <para>The next step after you have named a new release
        creation is to define its content. Please note that this step
        is used both to define the content of a new release and also
        to modify an existing one. To access the release configuration
        screen click on the version number or name (see <xref
        linkend="FigureAPartOfTheGSAProjectReleaseScreen" />).</para>

        <para>The Release Configuration screen that is now in front of you is
        divided in 4 steps. It is quite a long page but the steps are
        documented on the screen and are easy to understand. Remember that
        each step has its own validation button and before you go the next you
        must validate the one you&#39;ve been working on.</para>

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 1 - Give Release information</emphasis></para>

            <para>The first step gives you a chance to modify some of the
            information you gave before like the release name, the status and
            the related package. You must also provide a Release Date and
            either cut and paste or upload Release Notes and ChangeLog.</para>

            <para>The Release Notes is typically a short (10 to 20 lines) and
            high-level document that summarizes the new features delivered in
            this release with a focus on the user visible changes (new UI, new
            functions, new APIs...). This is an important document and all new
            releases should definitely have one. Release Notes are immensely
            helpful to the community to determine whether they need to
            upgrade to the next release.</para>

            <para>The ChangeLog is a much more technical document. It contains
            all bugs fixed in this new release as well as any change in the
            design or the architecture. This document is not as critical as
            the previous one to the normal end-user but it is absolutely

            <para>As explained above multiple files can be attached to the
            same release. Before the files can be attached one has to upload
            them on the CodeX server. To this end, the CodeX server offers an
            upload mechanism via FTP (ou SCP). To upload your files follow the
            instruction on the screen and don&#39;t forget to refresh the Web
            page to see the new uploaded files with the &#34;Refresh&#34;
            button. Alternatively, if you are a MS Windows user, you can also
            see the FTP Incoming space directly from Windows Explorer and drag
            and drop your files in there (see <xref
            linkend="MSWindowsSharedResources" />). Then refresh the CodeX Web
            page to see your files.</para>

            <para>Before you upload the files make sure you gave them names
            that will speak to CodeX users. Ideally the file names should
            include the release label in it and any other extension telling
            whether it is a source file or a binary file.</para>

            what type of archive it is). This step is not mandatory but

            on your screen. If some CodeX users monitor your package, Step 4
            will tell you how many of them are doing so. CodeX gives you the

      <title>Setting Access Permissions</title>
      
      <para>By default, packages and releases have no specific access
      permissions: access to all files is granted to any CodeX
      registered user (anonymous users are not allowed to download
      release files).  However, in some cases, you might want to limit
      the users allowed to download your software.  In these specific
      cases, you can restrict access permissions to your packages and
      releases to specific user groups. See <xref linkend="UserGroups"
      /> for more information on user groups.

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Package
          permissions</emphasis></para>

          <para>By clicking on 'Define Permissions' on the package
          administration screen (see <xref
          linkend="FigureAPartOfThePackageAdministrationScreenGSAProject"
          />), a project member with the 'File Manager Admin' right
          (see <xref linkend="UserPermissions" />) can attach access
          permissions to any existing package.</para>

          <para>The package permissions edition page (<xref
          linkend="FigurePackagePermissions" />) lists all the project
          user groups. Simply select the user groups that will be
          allowed to download files from the package and press
          submit. You may select several groups at the same time if
          needed. If you press 'Reset To Defaults', the access
          permissions to this package will be reset, so any registered
          user will be able to download it.
          </para>

          <para>Note that each time you edit permissions associated to
          a package, the previous values are reset. So, for instance,
          if you grant permissions to 'project members', submit, then
          want to grant permissions to another group, do not forget to
          select also 'project members' the second time, or they will
          not have access to your package.</para>

          <para>By default, permissions attached to a package apply to
          all releases and files that belong to this package.  But you
          may also set different permissions to specific releases (see
          below).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Release permissions</emphasis></para>

          <para>If you need finer grained access control to your
          software, you can also define permissions at the release
          level.</para>

          <para>The procedure is similar to the package permissions
          definition. Simply click on 'Define Permissions' on the
          release administration page (see <xref
          linkend="FigureAPartOfTheGSAProjectReleaseScreen" />) to
          attach access permissions to a release. Then select allowed
          user groups and submit.</para>

          <para>If you do not specify any access permissions for a
          release (or reset them to default), it inherits the access
          permissions from the package it belongs to. However, when
          you define a permission for a release, then it overrides the
          permissions defined for the package.</para>

          <para>The permissions set for the release can be either
          stricter or less strict than the package permissions.
          </para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para><tip><title>Tip: Updating existing permissions</title>

        <para>There is a shortcut to update package and release
        permissions. For project administrators or file manager
        administrators, the main 'Files' page displays small lock
        icons next to protected packages and releases. Simply click on
        the lock to update permissions for the corresponding object.

    <title>Quick File Release</title>

      <para>CodeX also provides you with a quick File Release mechanism. To
      access the short version of the Release Process click on the [Quick Add
      File Release...] link in the lower right corner of your Project
      Administration page, or in the Files Admin page. The Quick File Release page is a one step process
      where you can specify all the necessary information at the same time.
      The counterpart is that you can only attach one single file to a given
      release and not several as in the full File Release process.</para>

      <para>In addition the Quick File Release screen allows you to upload the
      attached file in 2 different ways:
         <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

           <listitem>
             <para><emphasis role="underline">FTP</emphasis>: upload
             your file via ftp as above and then select the
             appropriate file name from the &#34;Select a File&#34;
             pull down menu.</para>
           </listitem>

           <listitem>
             <para><emphasis role="underline">Direct
             Upload</emphasis>: you can upload the file via the Web
             interface by using the &#34;Browse&#34; button and
             pointing to the appropriate file on your local
             disk.</para>
           </listitem>

          </itemizedlist>
       </para>

      <para>Don&#39;t forget to specify the hardware architecture and the file
      type. Then push on the &#34;Release File&#34; button at the bottom of
      the screen.</para>
      <para>If some CodeX users were monitoring the package, they will 
      automatically receive an email notification, unless you set the release
      status to 'Hidden'.</para>
