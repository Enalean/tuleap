  <title>Becoming a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Citizen</title>

  <section id="ClassesOfCitizens">
    <title>Classes of Citizens</title>

    <para>Before we go further into the user registration process it
    is worth reviewing the various types of &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; citizens. There are
    basically 4 of them:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Anonymous Users</emphasis>: when
	you first visit the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site you are typically an anonymous
	user. Anonymous users can browse the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site but
	many of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; services or &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; resources cannot be used
	or accessed by an anonymous user (e.g. source code access is
	not possible, all the monitoring facilities aren&#39;t either,
	etc.). So we strongly advise you to become a registered
	user to take full advantage of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Registered Users</emphasis>: once
	you have created your own account (see below) you can use your
	login/password to authenticate yourself with &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. Registered
	users have access to all &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; projects including source code
	unless the project administrators decided otherwise. And since
	the system knows about you, it enables you to customize your
	view of the system through your Personal Page, monitor Forums,
	software release, receive support request follow-ups, site
	updates and many other useful things.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Project Members</emphasis>: users
	who are actively working on a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted project. To become
	a project member, you must first become a registered user and
	then ask a project administrator to include you in the project
	members. Most of the time project members are part of the
	project team but are not limited to software developers. They
	can be in charge of the support activity, the project
	documentation or the project management.  Project members can
	be granted different rights by the Project Administrator
	according to their role in the team (see <xref
	linkend="ProjectAdministration" /> for more details).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Project Administrators</emphasis>:
	registered users who create a new &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; project are elected as
	the first Project Administrators. Project Administrators have
	full rights over their projects except project deletion - a
	very unusual operation - that can only be done by a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team
	member. In the course of the project life, the initial project
	administrator can grant (or revoke) the status of project
	administrator to any project member.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Restricted Users</emphasis>: users
	who are project members, or even project administrators, but
        with restricted access rights: they cannot access pages from 
        projects they are not member of.
        This special role is only enabled on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; servers in heterogeneous 
        environments where corporate users and external consultants 
        share the same server.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  </section>

  <section id="UserRegistration">
    <title>User Registration</title>

    <para>As suggested above, the first thing to do for a newcomer is to
      create her own account on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. Becoming a registered &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; user
      doesn&#39;t imply any commitment on your part to host any of your
      software projects on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. It simply gives you more freedom when you
      browse the site and allows &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; to serve you with personalized
      information.</para>

    <para>Registering on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; is quick and easy:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Select the &#34;New User&#34; link</para>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Give the following information (all items marked with an
          asterisk are mandatory):</para>

	<substeps>
	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Login Name</emphasis>: your
	    user name. On some &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; systems that are connected to an
	    enterprise directory you may have to use a pre-defined
	    user name.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Password</emphasis>: 6 characters
              minimum and repeat it twice to make sure you didn&#39;t make any
              typo in the first occurrence</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Full Real Name</emphasis>: what&#39;s
              your name again?</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">E-mail Address</emphasis>:
	    depending on the site configuration valid email addresses
	    may be limited to those in the &SYS_ORG_NAME; domain (or
	    &SYS_ORG_NAME; affiliated domains). Make sure your email
	    address is correct or you won't receive the registration
	    confirmation message in your mailbox and won't be able to
	    complete the registration process.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Time Zone</emphasis>: choose the time
              zone you live in. Choosing the correct time zone is really
              important. Behind the scene &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; stores all time stamps in GMT
              time. Choosing the right time zone allow s &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; to translate
              all time stamps to your local time on the Web pages.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Site Updates</emphasis>: check this
              box if you want to receive site updates from the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team.
              This is a low traffic distribution list and we strongly advise
              you to check this box (default). You&#39;ll receive e-mail from
              us about the site maintenance, the important event in the life
              of the site, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; presentation/training announcement and the
              &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; newsletter.</para>
	  </step>

	  <step>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Additional Community Mailings</emphasis>: check
              this box if you want to receive notification about less
              important events. You can safely check this box as well if you
              want because we seldom use it. So we assure you that you
              won&#39;t be overwhelmed with tons of e-mail.</para>
	  </step>
	</substeps>
      </step>

      <step>
	<para>Shortly after you validate the registration form you will
          receive a message in your mailbox which includes a URL. Clicking on
          this URL will bring you to a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; form asking for your
          login/password again. If they match then your account is validated
          and you are now logged into the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <tip>
      <title>Tip: &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; servers with LDAP authentication</title>

      <para>Your &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; server might be set up to use an external LDAP directory for 
      authentication. In this case, the registration phase is even simpler: simply 
      type your LDAP login and password, and the system will automatically extract
      most of the required information from the LDAP directory: email 
      address, real name, etc.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>This 2-step registration process has been put in place for
      security reasons. Assuming people create their account with an alien
      e-mail address while they have access to the Intranet, they
      won&#39;t be able to validate their account from the outside because the
      &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; machine is behind the firewall. Therefore, an account cannot
      be validated from outside.</para>

    <tip>
      <title>Tip: What if I loose my password or my login name?</title>

      <para>Don&#39;t Panic and, above all, do not create a new account! Go
        to the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Login Page and click on the [Lost your password?] link.
        You&#39;ll be asked your login name and from that &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; will send you
        an e-mail message with an embedded URL. Click on this URL and give
        your new password.</para>

      <para>And what if I loose both my login and password? Gee! In this
        case use the search box and, assuming that you gave your full real
        name when you first registered, search for your last name and see if
        you can find your login again in the list of selected users. If so,
        apply the previous procedure. If not then contact us!</para>
    </tip>
  </section>

  <section id="LoginAndPersonalPage">
    <title>Login and Personal Page</title>

    <para>To log into the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site, go to the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Site at <ulink
								     url="http://&SYS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN;/">http://&SYS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN;</ulink> and click
      on the &#34;Login&#34; link. If
      you typed your login and password OK, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; presents you with your
      Personal Page (or Personal Dashboard) (<xref linkend="FigureThePersonalPageOfACodendiUser" />). At
      any point in time you can return to your &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Personal Page by
      selecting the &#34;My Personal Page&#34; in the upper part of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
      Main Menu.</para>

    <para>Your Personal Page is a dashboard from where you can quickly
    go to &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; workplaces and information spaces. You'll see bugs and
    tasks assigned to you in the various projects you belong to. In
    addition the bug section also shows those bugs that you have
    submitted including to foreign projects. By doing so, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; allows
    you to follow the evolution of bugs that you have reported and you
    might be impatient to see fixed.</para>

    <figure id="FigureThePersonalPageOfACodendiUser">
      <title>The Personal Page of a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; user</title>
      
      <mediaobject>

	  <imagedata format="PNG"
		     fileref="../../screenshots/en_US/sc_mypersonalpage.png" />
	</imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; allows you to personalize your page to fit your needs. 
    The content of your page is made of <emphasis>widgets</emphasis>. All widgets can be moved, 
    collapsed or closed. Some of them can provide an rss feed or 
    preferences can be set.</para>
    
    <para>New widgets can be added through the link "Add widgets". Here is an
    incomplete list of available widgets for the personal page:</para>
    
    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Monitored File Packages</emphasis> lists packages that you are currently monitoring, by project. To cancel
    any of the monitored items just click on the trash icon
    (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG"
    fileref="../../icons/trash.png"
    /></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>) next to the item
    label.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Monitored Forums</emphasis> lists forums that you are currently monitoring, by project. To cancel
    any of the monitored items just click on the trash icon
    (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG"

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">My Artifacts</emphasis> lists artifacts you have submitted or assigned to you, by project.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">My Bookmarks</emphasis> lists your favorite 
        bookmarks (your favorite pages in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; or external). Note that in many cases &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; uses
        URL with enough embedded information to bookmark sophisticated
        items like Software Map browsing, typical search in your project
        Bug or Task database, etc ... Bookmarked items can be edited which
        means that both the title of the bookmark and its destination URL
        can be modified.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">My Projects</emphasis> lists the projects you belong to. Selecting any of these projects
    brings you to the corresponding Project Dashboard.

  </section>

  <section id="AccountMaintenance">
    <title>Account Maintenance</title>

    <para>You provided a certain amount of demographic information to &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
      when you first registered on the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site. This and other information
      can be modified at any time by selecting the &#34;Account
      Maintenance&#34; item in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu.</para>

    <para>Most of the items on the &#34;Account Maintenance&#34; page will
      look obvious to you. However, we would like to draw your attention on
      some of them:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">Edit My Skills Profile</emphasis>: a
          user can make his resume available on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. The intent here is to
          let people know about you, your technical background and your domain
          of expertise. Very useful to get to know each other.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">SSH shared keys</emphasis>: this one has
          to do with the Shell Account service. When you are a registered
          user, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; server gives you a personal shell account with the
          same login/password as for the Web interface. To automate the shell
          login you can share a public encryption key with &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; and use the
          secure shell SSH to access &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; instantly without having to type a
          password. More on that in <xref linkend="ShellAccount" /></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>
  
  <section id="UserPreferences">
   <title>Preferences</title>
     <para>
        Your preferences are available in My personal Page -> Preferences.
        Here are some of the preferences you can define:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
     <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Remember my Login/Password</emphasis>:
          by default your current login session on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; is terminated
          whenever you stop your Web browser. When you restart your browser
          and visit &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; you will be asked for your login/password again. By
          checking this box you ask &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; to remember about your
          login/password forever or at least until you explicitly select the
          &#34;Logout&#34; item in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu. For security reasons
          we do not recommend using this feature unless you are equipped with 
          a strictly personal desktop machine</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">CSV separator</emphasis>:
          &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; provides you export and import functionalities
          (See <xref linkend="ProjectDataExport" /> for details).
          The import/export format is CSV format. Like CSV norm is
          not implemented by the same way in each software, we allow you
          to change the CSV separator, in order to fit with your
          preferred software!
          The available separators are:
          <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
            <listitem><para>comma (,) : the default separator.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>semicolon (;) : used by default by the french version of Excel.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>tab (tab).</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>
      </listitem>
      
      <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">CSV date format</emphasis>:
          &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; provides export and import functionalities
          (See <xref linkend="ProjectDataExport" /> for details).
          The import/export format is CSV format. Like CSV norm is
          not implemented by the same way in each software, we allow you
          to change the CSV date format, in order to fit with your
          preferred software!
          The available formats are:
          <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
            <listitem><para>month/day/year : the default format (generally used in United States).</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>day/month/year : used by default by the french version of Excel.</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          This format will be used to generate the exported artifacts, and will also be used
          when importing. Then, don't forget to check your dates value before importing.
          They should be the same format as defined in your preferences.
