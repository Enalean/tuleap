  <title>Document Manager</title>

  <para>Documentation is probably the second most important deliverable in a
    software project after the software work products themselves. CodeX
    provides a specific service to manage your project documents.</para>

  <para>Although the CodeX Document Manager cannot be compared
    with dedicated document management systems, it
    is however very handy to publish documents that are critical to
    your community of users. Examples are: Installation, Administration
    or User Guide, API documentation, Frequently Asked Questions,
    etc...</para>

  <para>The Document Manager features are as follows:</para>
