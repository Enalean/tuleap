    <title>Project Administration</title>

    <para>Whenever you enter the Project Dashboard of a given
    project or any of its service you&#39;ll see a menu item called
    Admin appears in the project menu.</para>

    <para>Only project members can access the Project Administration page. All
    other &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users are denied access to this part of a project.</para>

    <section id="ProjectAdministrationMenu">
      <title>Project Administration Menu</title>

      <para>In addition to the project main menu that was introduced in the
      description of the Project Dashboard, the Project Administration page
      has its own menu. This menu is not redundant with the page content right
      below. Except for 1 or 2 items the menu and the page content give access
      to distinct parts of the administration space. So pay attention to both
      the Page Admin menu and the Page Admin content. In the following
      sections the Location label indicates where to find the corresponding
      administrative function.</para>

      <title>Adding/Removing Users</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Page Admin Content</emphasis></para>

      <para>User administration in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; is easy. Regarding the number of
      users to need to add, you can use one the two following ways:
      </para>
      
      <section id="AddingSingleUser">
        <title>Add a user</title>
          <para> To add a new member to a
          project team one of the project administrator just has to type the login
          name of the invited member and click on the &#34;Add User&#34; button.
          If you don&#39;t know the login name of the new project member you want
          to add, open a new browser window on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; and use the search box in the
          &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu to search for the person&#39;s real name (first or last
          name or both) and don&#39;t forget to select &#34;People&#34; in the
          Search pull-down menu. The result list will show you the user real name
          and login name.</para>
      </section>
      
      <section id="UserImport">
        <title>Import a list of users</title>
        <para>If the number of users to add is important, 
          one of the project team member can import a list
          of users from a simple text file. In order to do it,
          just click the link &#34;Import List Of Users&#34;.
          Then, you can browse your local directory to select a file
          containing the list of users you want to import. The file will 
          host one user per line, by specifying her email address, or her
          &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; username (login name).</para>
          <example>
            <title>Sample of users import file</title>
               <programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
johnd
steve.robinson@company.com

bob.johnson@company.com
smith3
john.smith@company.com</programlisting>
          </example>
          <para>The import process has two steps.
          First, it checks if the file is well formed, and it displays
          the users detected to be imported.
          After a confirmation, the import is done and the users are added
          to the project.
          The system doesn't perform the import in case of error (unknown user,
          user not recorded in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;, user not active, unknown email address, etc.)
          If a user is two times in the file, only one user is added and there is no
          error.</para>
      </section>
      
      <section id="RemovingUser">
        <title>Removing a user</title>
          <para>Removing a project member is even easier. Just click on the trash
          icon (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG"
          fileref="../../icons/trash.png" /></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>) next
          to the person&#39;s name to revoke his/her membership. Revoking
          membership has absolutely no effect on the history and the data
          integrity of the project. In other words all tracker artifacts assigned or submitted by this person will continue to show
          up as before in the project database. Only the ability of this person to
          perform project management tasks is affected. Also notice that in order
          to remove a project administrator from the project member list, another
          project administrator must first change the &#34;Project Admin&#34; flag
          of this user to &#34;No&#34; in the User Permission table. In other
          words, a Project Administrator cannot be removed from the project
          members as long as she has administrator privilege.</para>
      </section>

      <note><para>You have probably noticed that project member&#39;s
      name on the Project Administration page are actually hyperlinks. On this
      page as well as in many other pages throughout &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; a click on a login
      name leads you to the user page where you can know more about the user
      (including its location, phone/fax number, etc. extracted from the LDAP 
      Directory in real time) and send an e-mail message to this person
      directly via a Web form.</para></note>

    </section>


    <section id="ServiceConfiguration">
      <title>Service Configuration</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>The &#34;Service Configuration&#34; item of the Project Administration
      menu lists all services available to the project. Services are items listed 
      in the  &#34;Service Bar &#34; on top of each page: trackers, 
      CVS, homepage, documentation, etc. 
      The Service Configuration page allows a project 
      administrator to update, enable, disable or even create services.
      </para>

      <para>There are two kinds of services:</para>
 
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">System services</emphasis>:
          these services are defined by the site administrator and are common to
          all projects. They cannot be modified, except for their status 
          (enabled/disabled) and their position on the screen (see below).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Project services</emphasis>: 
          these services can be fully customized or deleted by the project administrator.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>There is one exception, the
          <emphasis role="bold">Home Page</emphasis> service is a
          system service but it can be customized with any URL. Each
          project hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; has its own virtual Web server available on
          the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site. By default the &#34;Home Page&#34; in the Project
          Service Bar links to this location (see <xref linkend="ProjectWebSite" /> for more details).
          If you want the Home Page of your project to link to some other
          locations on the Intranet or on the Web, simply replace
          the default value with your own Web location. Do not confuse your
          Project Home Page with your Project Dashboard. The Project Home
          Page actually points to real Web Site whereas the Project Dashboard page is just an entry point to monitor a project progress.</para>


    <section id="ServiceCreation">
      <title>Creating or Updating a Service</title>
      <para>When creating or updating a service, one has to fill the following fields:</para>
     <procedure>
        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Service Label</emphasis>:
          This is the label that will be displayed in the Service Bar. It 
          should be as concise as possible.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Service Link</emphasis>:
          This is the URL of the service, i.e. the address the user will be 
          redirected to when clicking on the service label in the Service Bar.
          It will be loaded in the current window.
          </para>
          <para>A few keywords can be inserted into the link: they will be automatically replaced by their value:

        </step>

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Enabled</emphasis>:
          Toggling this check box will simply disable (or enable)
          the service. Disabling a service just
          means that it no longer appears in the Service Bar and in the  
          Project Dashboard of your
          project but all existing data related to this service remains
          untouched. In other words, re-enabling the service will restore
          the service in the exact same state it was when you first
          disabled it. See also &#34;Deleting a Service&#34; below. 
          </para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Rank on Screen</emphasis>:
	    this arbitrary number allows you to define the position of
	    this service in the Service Bar relative to other services. 
	    The services with smaller values will appear first. The
	    rank values don't have to be consecutive values. It is a
	    good idea to use values like 10, 20, 30,... so that it is
	    easy for you to insert new services in the future without
	    having to renumber all the services.</para>
        </step>
      </procedure>
    </section>

    <section id="ServiceDeletion">
      <title>Deleting a Service</title>

      <para>Project services can be deleted. They appear with a small
      trash icon in the service list. Just click on this icon to
      suppress the service from the database. The service data are
      however preserved.
      </para>
      <para>System services cannot be deleted. However, you can 
      disable them and they will not appear in the Service Bar.

    <section id="ServicesAdministration">
      <title>Services Administration</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Admin page</emphasis></para>

      <para>The project administration page gives direct access to the
      administration of all services that have been activated for a
      given project. This is available in the form of a series of
      pointers located on the lower left part of the project
      administration page. Only project members with appropriate
      permission are allowed to access the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; services
      administration pages (see <xref linkend="UserPermissions"
      />).</para>

    </section>


    <section id="ReferenceConfiguration">
      <title>Reference Pattern Configuration</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>The &#34;Reference Configuration&#34; item of the Project Administration
      menu lists all reference patterns available to the project. 
      The &#34;Reference Configuration&#34; page allows a project 
      administrator to update, enable, disable or even create reference patterns.
      </para>

    <section id="ReferenceOverview">
      <title>Reference Overview</title>

      <para>References are a powerful tool that allow cross-referencing of &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; objects.
      Based on a text pattern, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; automatically creates hyperlinks to the desired object.
      </para>

      <para>When typing a follow-up comment or a commit message, any text containing the
      pattern "XXX #NNN" will be interpreted as a reference to the object of type XXX with ID number NNN.
      For instance, 'artifact #123' is recognized as a reference to artifact number 123, and 
      &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; automatically creates a hyperlink that directly points to the details of artifact 123.
      </para>
      <para>You may also reference an object that belongs to another project. In that case, use 
      either 'XXX #group_id:NNN' or 'XXX #group_name:NNN' to reference object XXX number NNN 
      belonging to project which ID is 'group_id' or which short name is 'group_name'. 
      For instance, 'wiki #myproj:Welcome' is a reference to the 'Welcome' wiki page of the project 'myproj'.
      </para>
      <para>Some reference patterns may need more than one parameter. In this case, use '/' as a separator 
      between parameters. For example, 'wiki #Welcome/2' creates a reference to the wiki page named 'Welcome' at version '2'.
      </para>

      <para>There are two kinds of reference patterns:</para>

 
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">System reference patterns</emphasis>:
          these reference patterns are defined by the site administrator and are common to
          all projects. They cannot be modified, except for their status 
          (enabled/disabled).
          </para>
          <para>Most system references are related to a specific service. For example,
          'artifact', 'doc', 'file' or 'wiki' are respectively related to the tracker,
          document manager, file manager and Wiki services. In order to facilitate 
          the usage of such reference patterns, they are automatically enabled and disabled
          when the corresponding service is enabled/disabled. Still, it is always 
          possible to enable or disable those reference patterns manually.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Project reference patterns</emphasis>:

      </itemizedlist>
    </section>


    <section id="ReferencePredefined">
      <title>Predefined Reference Patterns</title>
<para>Here is a list of predefined reference patterns:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">art #num or artifact #num</emphasis>: 
        Reference to artifact number 'num'. Note that 'num' is a system-wide number and is unique across projects. This reference links to the artifact detail/update page. In addition to the 'art' and 'artifact' keywords, artifacts may be referenced using the related tracker short name. For example, an artifact in the bug tracker can be referenced with <emphasis role="bold">bug #NNN</emphasis>, a support request with <emphasis role="bold">sr #NNN</emphasis>, a task with <emphasis role="bold">task #NNN</emphasis> and a patch with <emphasis role="bold">patch #NNN</emphasis>. So, when you create a custom tracker, make sure that you specify a meaningful tracker short name.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">commit #num or cvs #num</emphasis>: 
        Reference to CVS commit number 'num'. This is a system-wide number. The reference links to the commit details page: log message, impacted files, link to diff view, etc.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">rev #num or revision #num or svn #num</emphasis>: 
        Reference to Subversion revision number 'num'. This is a project-specific number, so if you need to reference a revision belonging to another project, you should specify the project in the reference (e.g. 'rev #myproj:123'). The reference links to the subversion revision details page: log message, impacted files, link to diff view, etc.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">wiki #wikipage and wiki #wikipage/num</emphasis>: 
        Reference to a wiki page named 'wikipage'. The second format allows one to specify a wiki page version. Wiki pages are project specific, so if you need to reference a page belonging to another project, you should specify the project in the reference.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">doc #num or document #num</emphasis>: 
        Reference to the document number 'num'. This is a system-wide number. Document numbers, or IDs, are visible in the 'Docs' main page by hovering over a document title with the mouse pointer. This reference links to the document itself.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">news #num</emphasis>: Reference to the news item number 'num'. This is a system-wide number. The reference links to the news item page, where you can add comments.</para></listitem>

<para>
While working in the development or the maintenance phase of a software project, it is vital to keep track of the changes made to the source code. This is what Version Control systems like CVS and Subversion do. In addition to keeping track of the source code change history it is often critical to relate the changes to the artifact (a task, a defect or a support request) that led the developers to make a change in the code. And conversely, when reading the artifact description it is also very helpful to immediately see how the change was implemented.
</para><para>
The integration of CVS and Subversion in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; precisely provide the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users with this bi-directional cross-referencing mechanism. This is achieved through the use of references that are automatically detected by &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; in either the follow-up comments of the project artifacts or in the messages attached to a CVS or SVN commit.
</para>
<para>The system is not limited to artifact and commit references, so you may also reference the forum message where the bug was found, the documentation that describes an issue, or the file that fixes it. The system is flexible enough to allow referencing of items that are not stored in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. So you may now create your own reference pattern to link to an external document manager like DocuShare, or source code management tool like ClearCase</para>

      <para><tip><title>Tip: cross-reference artifacts and Source Code
      commits</title><para>It is considered a best practice to always
      reference a bug, a task or a support request in any of the log
      message attached to a Subversion or CVS commit. Similarly when closing
      the related artifact (task, bug,etc.) make sure you mention the
      revision or commit number in the follow-up comment. You will find this
      extremely convenient while trying to keep track of the changes
      and why they were made.</para></tip></para>

        <title>Tip: Combining pre-defined groups with additional members</title>

        <para>Sometimes, you might want to grant some permissions to
        all project members and some other &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users.  In this case,
        you might be tempted to build a user group from the list of
        project members and to add the other users to the group.  The
        issue with this solution is that if new members join the
        project, they will have to be manually added to the group. So
        it is more convenient to create a group containing only the
        users that are not member of the project. And then,
        permissions should be granted to this group and to the
        pre-defined "project members" group.

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; is very appealing to many project development teams
      because it provides full-featured project development and
      management tools. A software project can be managed almost
      entirely from within &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. However a project team may need to
      perform some additional processing on the project data. It may
      need to report about progress made, what goes well or wrong, how
      far you are from the end date, derive statistical data,
      etc.</para>

      <para>It is far beyond the scope of &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; to provide project
      teams with such reporting tools. There are many specialized
      tools on the market to generate progress reports and each
      project team has its favorite one. In order to satisfy this
      diversity of needs, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team has developed a very
      efficient system that allows the project team to export the
      project data outside of &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; for re-use in other tools like
      MS Access, Excel, Crystal Report, Open Office,  or
      any other ad-hoc tools.</para>

      <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; provides you with 2 kinds of Data Export:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Text File Export</emphasis>:
          this is a simple text extract of your project data. It uses
          the well known CSV (Comma Separated Value) format. CSV is
          recognized by almost every Office Suite or database tool on
          the market. In case you want to develop your own report
          application most programming languages also come with a
          standard library that knows how to parse CSV format. </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Direct Database
          Connection</emphasis>: so to speak this is not a Data
          Export. It is rather a direct connection to your project
          database through an ODBC or JDBC driver. If you want to
          manipulate your project data with a database tool (like
          MS-Access or an ODBC/JDBC application) this is certainly the
          best choice.</para>

    </itemizedlist>


    <section id="ExportedData">
      <title>Exported Data</title>
      <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; gives access to the following data (details on exported fields are listed on the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; page): </para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

    <section id="TextFileExport">
      <title>Text File Export</title>

      <para>Text File Export follow the well known CSV (Comma
      Separated Values) format, recognized by almost every Office
      Suite on the market. It can easily be imported in MS-Access,
      MS Excel, OpenCalc&hellip;</para>

      <section id="ImportingCSVFilesinExcel">
	<title>Importing CSV Files in Excel</title>
	<para>Clicking on any of the table export link (Bug
	Export, Task Export,..) on the Project Data Export page 
	generates and downloads a CSV file that you can save on your
	local disk or directly open in Excel or any other spreadsheet
	of your choice. No particular setting is required in most cases.
    Nevertheless, you can change the CSV separator and the date format 
    (see <xref linkend="UserPreferences" />)
    if the default one doesn't correspond with your Excel version
    <footnote><para>For example, by default, the separator for the french version 
    of Excel is the semicolon instead of the comma.</para></footnote>.

	    follow-up comments (details field) and original comment
	    must be declared as type Memo. Failing to do so will cause

      <para>To offer maximum flexibility &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; also provides a direct
      access to your project data via an ODBC or JDBC database
      connection. Once installed on your PC the MySQL
      ODBC (or JDBC) driver allows a transparent access to your
      project specific database tables.</para>

	<title>Generating Your Project Database</title>

	<para>Before you attempt to access your project data with

	<literal>Project Admin -> Project Data Export</literal> and
	click on the 'Generate Full Project Database' link at the
	bottom of the page.The 'Generate Full Project Database' link
	generates a snapshot of your project data. This means you must
	click on the link again each time you want the project
	database to be updated with current data.</para>

	<para>If everything goes well your project database will be
	generated in real time and a message will tell you about the

	to use to connect to the remote database from your
	desktop. Write them down and keep them in a safe
	place. </para>

	<note><para><emphasis role="bold">Remark</emphasis>: if your project
