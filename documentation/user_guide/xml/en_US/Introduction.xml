    <para>The goal of the &SYS_ORG_NAME; Code eXchange Initiative
    (CodeX) is to transpose and apply the principles of Open Source
    [XOSP] into our own corporate environment. Establishing
    collaborative software development and project management
    practices as one of our core software engineering values will
    improve the quality of our software and the productivity of our
    development teams while providing a rich, attractive and cost
    efficient.</para>

    <para>The CodeX initiative is supported by an internal Web site of
    the same name that is available at <ulink
    url="http://&SYS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN;/">http://&SYS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN;/</ulink>.
    <!-- The CodeX web site is provided as a service to all
    &SYS_ORG_NAME; software development teams who want to work
    efficiently in a collaborative mode.  While being well and alive
    the software community at &SYS_ORG_NAME; is also asking for more
    communication and has a strong desire to establish bridges with
    the rest of the company. Further, it shows a desire to speed up
    the innovation process and to develop more flexible, better
    quality and more usable software in less time. --></para>

    <para>The CodeX User Guide was written not only to describe the
    CodeX features and services; it is also packed with tips and
    guidelines to help you get the most out of CodeX and manage your
    project in an optimal way.</para>

    <para>We hope that you enjoy working with CodeX. If so, keep
    talking about the CodeX initiative to fellow programmers, project
    managers and managers. CodeX users are our best advocates. Also
    keep in mind that this User Guide is yours and, following source
    code sharing principles, we welcome your corrections and
    contributions.</para>
