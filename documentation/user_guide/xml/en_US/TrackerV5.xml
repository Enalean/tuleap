  <title>Tracker Service</title>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Disclaimer:</emphasis> this chapter covers the new version (aka v5) of Tracker service.
  For documentation on the legacy tracker system (v3) see <xref linkend="TrackerService" />.</para>

  <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker is one of the most powerful and versatile
  services offered to &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted projects. It allows for the tracking 
  of various artifacts like bugs, tasks, requirements, etc... and a 
  project can create and customize as many trackers as necessary.</para>

  <para>All trackers, whether predefined at the site level or created
  by a project can be fully customized. </para>

  <section id="TrackerV5TrackerPrinciples">
    <title>Terminology and common features</title>

    <para>Before we explain the features of the tracker service, it's
    worth spending some time on the terminology used in the tracker
    service as well as on some of the features that are shared by all
    trackers.</para>

    <para>As the Tracker Service is meant to track virtually any kind
    of item, the generic term &#34;<emphasis role="bold">artifact</emphasis>&#34; 
    will be used throughout this document to designate items that are being 
    tracked - be it bug, task, support request, user stories or other such type.</para>

    <para>Defining a tracker is just a matter of assigning it a name,
    choosing the fields that are going to be used in the tracker,
    and what values will be allowed in those fields.</para>

    <para>In addition to the project definable fields and field values there
    is a <emphasis role="bold">Follow-ups</emphasis> section that is permanently attached to a tracker
    artifact. This one allows you to follow the artifact lifecycle (values changed 
    and free text comments attached to an artifact and posted by users).
    In this section you can also add a <emphasis role="bold">follow-up comment</emphasis>
    that will be added in the follow-ups flow.
    </para>
  </section>


  <section id="TrackerV5EnteringtheTrackerService">
    <title>Entering the Tracker Service</title>

    <para>To enter the Tracker service of a given project, first go to
    the Project Summary page (see <xref
	linkend="AccessingAProjectSummaryPage" />) and either click
    the &#34;Trackers&#34; item in the Project Main Menu located in the
    upper part of the page or you can directly choose a tracker from the
    trackers listed in the Public Area of the Project Summary page.</para>

    <para>You will be presented with a list of trackers available for
    this particular project (see <xref linkend="TrackerV5WelcomeScreen"
	/>. Select the tracker you are interested in. Entering the
    tracker will give you access to various tracker functions
    depending on the permissions you have with this tracker. You may
    be able to submit new artifacts, update existing ones, search
    and browse the artifact database or configure the tracker.</para>

  <section id="TrackerV5ArtifactSubmission">
    <title>New Artifact Submission</title>

    <para>To submit a new artifact to a given project you must first
    access the appropriate tracker of that project as indicated in the
    section above (see <xref linkend="TrackerV5EnteringtheTrackerService" />.</para>

    <para>When entering a given tracker you are presented with the
    artifact selection and browsing screen (more about this facility
    in <xref linkend="TrackerV5ArtifactBrowsing" />). For now let&#39;s click
    on the &#34;Submit new artifact&#34; item (or whatever the artifact
    name is) from the Tracker Menu Bar in the upper part of the welcome
    screen (see <xref linkend="TrackerV5FigureASampleTrackerBrowsingScreen"
	/>).</para>

    <figure id="TrackerV5ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheProject">
      <title>A sample artifact submission screen (the artifact is of type &#34;bug&#34; here)</title>

    </figure>

    <para><xref linkend="TrackerV5ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheProject"
	/> shows a sample submission screen from one of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted
    projects. Because of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker high level of
    customizability no two submission screens look alike. Depending on
    the project more or less fields may appear on the tracker
    submission form and the name of artifact managed by the tracker
    may change as well.</para>

    <para>In the example provided on <xref
    linkend="TrackerV5ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheProject" /> the
    artifact type is a bug (also know as &#34;defect&#34; in corporate
    language). The user is asked to give a one-line description for the bug and a longer
    text entry field where you can fully characterize the bug. Then, he has to choose a bug Category
    and a Severeity. After clicking on the Submit button, a unique ID is automatically
    assigned to the submitted artifact.</para>

    <para>When submitting a new artifact, make the Summary and the
    detailed description as explicit as possible.  Do not use a
    clueless summary like: &#34;Service X doesn&#39;t work&#34; or
    &#34;Blocking problem in Document Mgr&#34;. Explain the exact
    nature of the artifact by giving an explicit Summary and
    Description to the person in charge. A unique ID is automatically
    assigned to the submitted artifact.</para>

    <para>The values proposed by a field could depend upon other field value. If javascript is activated in your browser, fields will be filtered dynamically. Otherwise, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; will ensure that the values you submit are correct.</para>

    <para>As explained above, artifact submission forms vary from one
    project to another depending on the fields used by the
    tracker. The submission form can also vary according to the
    permission level. Depending whether you are a project member or an
    ordinary registered user the artifact fields displayed on the
    screen may differ. As an example, on <xref
    linkend="TrackerV5ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheProject" />, the bug
    submitter using the form is probably a project member because
    giving access to the &#34;Assigned to&#34; field to an ordinary
    registered user doesn&#39;t make much sense. It is very unlikely
    that users external to the project team know enough about the
    project organization to correctly assign the bug. That's the reason why 
    artifact fields shown to users on the submission form can be
    configured in the Tracker Administration module (see <xref
    linkend="TrackerV5Administration" />)</para>

    <para>In any case don&#39;t forget to click on the
    &#34;Submit&#34; button when you are finished !</para>

  <section id="TrackerV5ArtifactBrowsing">
    <title>Artifact Browsing</title>

    <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers the ability to browse the artifact database
    according to a variable set of criteria.</para>

    <section id="TrackerV5ArtifactSelectionCriteria">
      <title>Selection Criteria</title>

      <para>The upper part of the artifact browsing screen is devoted to the
        selection criteria. <xref
	  linkend="TrackerV5FigureASampleTrackerBrowsingScreen" /> shows the
        default set of selection criteria that is available when a new tracker
        is created. You can select bugs by Category (the module in which the
        bug occurred), Group (nature of the bug like Crash, Documentation
        Typo, ...), Status (e.g. Open, Closed, ...) and Assignee (the person
        in charge of the bug). But you may also add or remove criteria 
        by using the "Toggle criteria" link.(for more details, see <xref
        linkend="TrackerV5Reports" />)</para>

      <para>How selection criteria are filled out depend on their
      field type. The Tracker Service currently has several types
      of fields used as search criteria:</para>

      <section id="TrackerV5ArtifactSelectBoxField">
	<title>Select Box Field and Multiple Select Box Field</title>

	<para>A select box field can take its value in a set of
	predefined values. By default, only one value can be selected at a time. If you
	want to select multiple values at once, use the Advanced Search
	facility by clicking on the + icon. A multi select box appears and allows the user to select multiple
	values for the same field.</para>

	<para>There might be 2 specific values in the list of choices:
	&#34;Any&#34; matches any value in the list and &#34;None&#34; matches the
	items where no value has been assigned yet</para>
      </section>


      <section id="TrackerV5ArtifactTextField">
	<title>Text Field</title>

        <para>A Text field can contain any kind of text. There are two
        ways to query a text field:</para>


	<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

	  <listitem>
	    <para> <emphasis role="underline">Keyword
	    search</emphasis>: you can type a series of space

    &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; is proposing two kinds of renderers : "Table" and "Charts".
    The "Table" renderer presents the list of matching artifacts using columns.
    The "Charts" renderer gives a graphical visualization of the results.
    Depending on the project, users may enjoy the ability to 
	choose from several graphical tracker renderers available in the renderer tabs section.
    
    Depending on the project, users may enjoy the ability to choose from several tracker reports

            <title>CSV File Parsing</title>
            <para>The CSV format that is accepted as import input 
            is accessible over the CSV file submission screen. 
            This page allows manual validation of the tracker 
            field names (shortname), indicating which fields are mandatory in
            case of a new artifact submission. In addition, it gives
            you a sample CSV file.
            As for the export feature, you can specify the separator
            used in the CSV file you want to import as well as the date format 
            (See <xref linkend="UserPreferences" />).
            If you already use the Tracker
            Artifact Export (see <xref linkend="ProjectDataExport" />)
            you will notice that the format of the files to import
            and the exported files are exactly the same. 
            This means that if you changed your CSV separator for exporting 
            data, you must use the same to import those data.
            You can refer to the export format especially
            for the date formats as well as the format of the
            follow-up comments (see <xref linkend="TrackerV5ArtifactComments" />).
            The first record in the CSV import file is always the 
            header row containing all the tracker field names that 
            will be used in the following artifact records.</para>
            
            <para>Depending on whether you want to import new artifacts
            or update the ones that already exist in the tracker you
            need to provide different information. Nevertheless,
            you can mix in one CSV file the submission of new artifacts
            and the update of existing ones. </para>
            
            <para>For the artifact creation you need to provide
            information on all fields that are specified
            as mandatory in the CSV import format except the Artifact 
            ID which must not be specified. You may omit
            the submitter and submission date. The artifact
            submitter is then automatically set to the
            user importing the CSV file and the submission date
            will be the date of the import.</para>
            
            <para>For the artifact update you need to provide the
            artifact identifier of the artifacts to update in the 
            special column 'aid'. Beside
            this, you only need to provide the fields you want
            to update. All fields not specified in the CSV file 
            will remain unchanged.</para>

            <para>The parsing method checks several potential errors 
                in the CSV file:

                If a .csv file is opened in Excel, any change to the spreadsheet 
                (even something as simple as a column resizing) may cause 
                Excel to modify and update the .csv file. Changes that may 
                occur include: dates, times and numbers converted to 
                the same format as those used by your system's regional 
                settings, single line feeds converted to line feed 
                and carriage return, extra commas appended to certain lines.
                </para>

                <para>
                The updated date format might not be compatible with the 
                &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; date format and potentially cause troubles when 
                importing such updated CSV files back into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;.
                On the other hand &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;-exported CSV files might not open correctly

                If you have a .csv file that either will not open correctly under 
                Excel or was opened in Excel and will not import 
                into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; please try the following:
                Make sure all applications are closed. Change your system's 
                regional settings (Start > Settings > Control Panel > Regional 
                Options) to use the English with the following formats: 
                Date = MM/dd/YYYY Time = hh:mm. Using Excel, open the 
                .csv files that don't import, make a column width change, 
                save the files and exit Excel. Go back and restore your 
                original regional settings. Import the "fixed" .csv file into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;.

	<listitem><para>Tasks</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
	Each of those templates have predefined fields that correspond
	to the specific work processes around bugs, tasks etc. In
	the following, we give a short overview of these different
	work processes. For each of those templates, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team
	also tried to maintain a fair balance between sophistication
	and ease of use. As a consequence, fairly simple and
	straightforward templates are configured by default for all
	new hosted projects. Then it is up to the project members to
	decide how much information they want to see attached to an
	artifact and customize their tracker configuration
	accordingly.

    <section id="TrackerV5BugTemplate">
      <title>The Bug Tracker Template</title> 

      <para>One of the golden rules in a collaborative project
      environment is to let your project community test the software
      and freely report on any defect (or bug) they have seen. The Bug
      template was developed with this objective in mind.</para>

      <para>The template Bug Tracker comes pre-configured with a set
      of fields (used or not) that are probably enough for the
      majority of projects hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. You can either decide that
      the template is lacking some critical fields that you can create
      or, on the contrary, switch some fields to the "Unused" status
      to make the tracker simpler.</para>

      <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Task tracker is a task manager and not a project
      management software like CA-SuperProject, MS-Project or other
      powerful and complex desktop products available on the
      market. The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Task Tracker cannot build a Pert
      chart, it doesn&#39;t have any planning capabilities. It is
      rather a time sheet tool which allows project members to track
      their time and manage other things like weekly TODO list for
      instance.</para>

      <para>However the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Task Tracker offer a number of

      Wikipedia</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The User Story tracker contains artifacts called "User Stories", that

      customize the tracker to fit the way it implements the methodology</para>

      <para>At the beginning of a Scrum project, each customer user story must 
      be stored. During the first Sprint Meeting, a few stories are selected by the team to be implemented 
      in the first iteration. The team then affects the stories to team members ('Owner') and can start 
      developing.</para>
     
      <para>At the end of the Sprint (after two to four weeks), the team meets

	  <para>As an example of how you can use these permissions
	  let's assume that you have created a tracker where several
	  of your customers can report defects on your software. In
	  such a situation, you may decide that a customer from a
	  given company should only see those defects that were
	  submitted by its employees and not those submitted by other
	  companies.</para>

	  <para>To achieve this you just need to create a group called
	  'company_A' in which you include the login names of all the
	  users working for company A. Then do the same with the group
	  'company_B' for company B. Those two groups will then be
	  given the 'access to artifacts submitted by group' type of
	  permission. In addition you probably want to grant 'access
	  to all artifacts' to the project members or to the
	  'tracker_administrators' groups so that your team members can
	  manage artifacts from any customer.</para>

        a defect tracking system with your customers you may want to
        hide some fields from the view of your customer or prevent
        them from modifying certain fields. This is precisely what
        this module is meant for.</para>

        
        <para>When using this configuration module, you can toggle the
        display between two different views: you can either view all
        user groups permissions for a given field OR for a given user
        group you can view all the field permissions defined for
        it. The experience shows that the view by field is often the
        preferred one when you configure a tracker for the first time
        whereas the view by group of users is more convenient to
        adjust the permission settings later on (see <xref
        linkend="UserGroups" /> for more information on how to define
        and manage groups of users).</para>

        <para>Each group of users can be granted the following
        permissions for a given field:</para>

        <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

  	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Can submit</emphasis>: this
	    permission determines whether a group of users can define
	    the initial value of a field when an artifact is first
	    submitted. If not checked, this field will not be visible
	    on the submission screen for this user group.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Read-only</emphasis>: if
	    granted read-only permission a group of users only has
	    read access to a field. In other words the users see the

	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Update</emphasis>: if granted
	    update permission, a group of users can see the current

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">-</emphasis>: this level of permission that displays as a hyphen
	    means that the group has no specific permission, like in tracker permissions.</para>
	  </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Important Note</emphasis>: the
        permissions associated with a field apply in many areas of a
        tracker. For instance if a group of users has no access to a
        given field, this field becomes invisible on the initial
        submission form, on the artifact search form as well as in the
        table of results returned by the search, in the artifact
        update form, in the history of changes associated with each
        artifact and finally in the email notification sent to this
        group of users.</para>

      <title>Field Usage Management</title>

      <para>When a tracker is first created, it comes pre-configured
      with a set of fields inherited form the template that was used
      to create it. For the majority of projects hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; it is
      very likely that the standard Tracker templates (e.g Bugs,
      Tasks, User strories) will cover most of the needs.</para>

      <para> However &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; gives you the ability to customize your trackers. 
      It can be a variation on an
      existing template with some fields or structural elements addition or removal or it can
      be an entirely new tracker created from an empty
      template.</para>
      
      <para>The Field Usage Manager is divided in two parts : a fields palette 
      on the left and a tracker visualization on the right (see

                    (e.g. the user that submitted the artifact, the Id of the

                    from your tracker definition, it won't be deleted but placed 
                    in this unused field section. It will then be easier to use it
                    again. If you really want to delete it, delete it from the 
                    unused field section.
                    Unused fields are also used in tracker template definition.
                    You can find here some fields that the team didn't decide to 
                    introduce in the template but that makes sense however. It is 
                    easy then to add such a field whereas creating from scratch.

            As trackers can be fully customized, you may need a way to define 
            what is the title of your artifacts, when you consider an artifact 
            to be open or close, or the field used to define the contributor (or assignee)
            of an artifact. This feature is provided by the admin section 
            "Semantics".
        </para>
        <para>
            Most of the trackers you will use already defined a semantic. 
            This is the case for instance for all tracker templates (see 
            <xref linkend="TrackerV5TrackerTemplates" />).
        </para>
        <para>
            To define or update a semantic field, select the pencil icon next to the

                For instance, it can be the field <emphasis role="bold">summary</emphasis> 
                for a bug tracker, the field <emphasis role="bold">name</emphasis> 
                for a contact tracker, or the field <emphasis role="bold">I want to</emphasis>

      <para>One frequently sees project members in

    <section id="TrackerV5EmailNotificationSettings">
      <title>Email Notification Settings</title>

      <para>As explained earlier in <xref
	  linkend="TrackerV5EmailNotification" /> the Tracker comes
      with a predefined set of rules to keep relevant people aware of
      the artifact life. The default rules can however be complemented
      or tuned in a number of ways:</para>

      <section id="TrackerV5GlobalEmailNotification">
	<title>Global Email Notification</title>

	<para>In addition to the default notification rules, the
	tracker administrators have the ability to specify a list of
	email addresses to which submissions of new
	artifacts (and optionally artifact updates) will be
	systematically sent. To add an email address, click the "add" link.
	You can add as many email addresses as required.
	<!--Note that in this case notifications will
	be sent to users regardless of their personal preferences
	defined (see section &#34;<xref
	linkend="TrackerV5EventRoleBasedEmailNotification" />&#34;
	below).--></para>
    
    <para>You can choose to disable the permission check for global 
    email notification.
    This can be useful if the email address is a mailing list,
    because individual permissions can't be checked for each
    member of the mailing list. So for mailing lists, if the check box
    "check permissions" is checked, the notifications will be send to each 
    member with the permissions of an anonymous user.
    </para>

	<para>This feature is typically used to send submissions of
	new artifacts to a number of well identified persons in the
	team who are in charge of qualifying and dispatching the
	artifacts.</para>

	    <title>Tip: Create a Distribution List to notify several people</title>

	  address in the Global Email Notification field.</para>

	    <para>Creating a Mailing List on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; has several

	<para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker offers to all project members the
	ability to be carbon-copied on all email notifications sent to
	some other project members.</para>

	<para>Here are a couple of examples where the tracker watch
	feature can be extremely useful:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Backups</emphasis>: when a
	    team member is away from the office it is often convenient
	    to delegate her artifact management activity to another

	    backup of another team member is as easy as inserting her
	    name in the Watchers field of the backup person when
	    the team member quits and remove it when the team member
	    returns.</para>

	    <para>As soon as you specify a person name in the 
	    watchers field you'll start receiving all the artifact
	    notification of this person and you can act accordingly on her
	    behalf.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">QA Contacts</emphasis>:
	    another possible use is for the QA team members to fill

	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<note><para>Remark: The goal of the tracker watch feature is not
	to spy on you. To make sure that you are only watched by
	authorized persons, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; always shows you the list of &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
	users who are currently watching your email 
	notifications. </para></note>

      <!--<section id="TrackerV5EventRoleBasedEmailNotification" xreflabel="Event/Role Based Notification Settings">
	<title>Event/Role Based Notification Settings</title>

	<para>This is the most sophisticated part of the customization
	process. It allows any user to specify what types of events
	they wants to be notified of by email. Note that these settings
	are project and user specific so you can tune your own email
	notification preferences for each tracker you are involved
	with.</para>

	<para>The customization matrix (see <xref
	    linkend="TrackerV5FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix" />) presents you with a
	series of check boxes. Each check box allows you to specify
	what kind of events you want to be aware of depending on
	the role you play with respect to the artifact.</para>

	<para>There are 4 roles defined with respect to an artifact:</para>

	<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Submitter</emphasis>: you are
	    the person who initially reported the artifact by filling
	    out the artifact submission form.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Assignee</emphasis>: you were
	    assigned the artifact and you are therefore responsible
	    for managing it.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">CC</emphasis>: you are
	    mentioned in the list of CC names (see <xref
	    linkend="ArtifactCCList" />).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Commenter</emphasis>: you have
	    once posted a follow-up comment in the artifact.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>For each of these roles you can instruct the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
	Tracker to send email notifications to you only when some
	specific events occur. Nine different events (see the right
	most column on <xref linkend="TrackerV5FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix"
	    />) are monitored by the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker. The description of the
	events is self explanatory and only appeal one comment: the
	first 8 events in the list can only occur on artifact
	updates. Only the last event relates to the submission of a
	new artifact.</para>

	<para>Let's review the sample matrix shown on <xref
	    linkend="TrackerV5FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix" /> and see, step by
	step, how this user has configured her notification
	settings:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>First let's look at the Commenter
	  column. The Commenter column says that this user has decided
	  that if she is involved in an artifact as a Commenter (she just
	  posted a follow-up comment at some point in time) then she is
	   only interested in receiving email notification when the
	  status of the artifact goes to &#34;Closed&#34; or when any of the fields
	  Priority, Status and Severity is modified. All other events
	  will be ignored by the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; tracker and no notification
	  will be sent to this user.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Second, looking at the matrix by row, one
	  can see that the user said that when she makes a
	  modification to an artifact herself (Event &#34;I am the
	  author of the change&#34;) she doesn't want to receive any
	  email notification whatever their role in this artifact
	  is. Please note that the event &#34;I am the author of the
	  change&#34; overlaps with other events. So in our example,
	  the submitter will not get a notification when she adds a new
	  artifact. Even if the event &#34;A new artifact has been
	  submitted&#34; is marked</para></listitem>

	  <listitem>
            <para>Finally, the user also said that when a new artifact
            is submitted to the project and is immediately assigned to
            her (Assignee role), she wants to be notified. However if
            she is the submitter of the new artifact then she is not
            interested in receiving the notification.</para>

	    <para>Note that the Commenter role is meaningless for the
	    event &#34;A new artifact has been submitted&#34; because
	    follow-up comments can only be added at update time not at
	    creation time. Also, the event &#34;I'm added or removed
	    from this role&#34; is meaningless for the Submitter and
	    the Commenter because these roles can not be modified in
	    an artefact.</para>
