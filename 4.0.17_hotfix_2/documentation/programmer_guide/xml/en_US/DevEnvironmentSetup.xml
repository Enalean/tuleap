    <title>Development Environment Setup</title>
    <para>
        In order to start developing for the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; platform, one 
        needs to setup a specific development environment, with source code as 
        well as configuration files and utilities. In this chapter, we will 
        describe how to create such an environment.
    </para>
    <section id="EnvRequirements">
      <title>Requirement: a Test Server</title>
      <para>
        The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; source code has been modified so that multiple 
        instances of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; software can run on the same physical 
        machine. The goal here is to allow each &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; developer to 
        have his/her own source tree available for modification and testing and 
        avoid any interference with other developers.
      </para>
      <para>
        When developing for &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;, it is strongly advised to test 
        your code on a different machine than the production server. Even if you 
        use a different source tree and a different database, there are always 
        risks that you might do something wrong that will impact your production 
        server. So you should setup a dedicated machine for all your code 
        development. Ideally, this machine should be identical to the production 
        server, or at least it should have exactly the same operating system 
        (same distribution, same version) and the same version of the tools 
        (CVS, Apache, PHP, MySQL, etc.).
      </para>
      <para>
        For simplification, we will describe the process of setting up development 
        environments that all share the same database server, and where specific 
        features like project web servers, documentation, user accounts, releases, 
        cron jobs and CVS repositories are also common to all environments. 
        Using separate resources is possible but requires a lot more efforts.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="CreateEnv">
      <title>Creating a Development Environment</title>
      <para>
        Initially, you need to create a 'test_server' directory in your home directory, 
        where you will install all necessary resources to develop, configure, 
        and run &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. You may setup files as you wish, but here, we 
        provide a guideline that will simplify things. So first, you should create 
        the following subdirectories:
      </para>

      <programlisting width="40" format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered">
        bin
        etc
        etc/codendi
        etc/httpd
        etc/httpd/conf
        httpd
        sfcache
        var
        var/log
        var/log/httpd
        var/run
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Then make links for your apache server
      </para>
      <programlisting width="40" format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered">
        cd etc/httpd
        ln -s /usr/lib/apache modules
        ln -s ../../var/log/httpd logs
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        After that, copy the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; configuration files to your environment:
      </para>
      <programlisting width="40" format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered">
        cp /etc/local.inc etc
        cp /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf etc/httpd/conf
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        Normally '/etc/local.inc' is not world-readable, so you either need to 
        give temporary access to this file, or use local.inc.dist from the SVN tree 
        that you will checkout later.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also create the 'bin/start_Codendi' script
      </para>
      <programlisting width="40" format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered">
        #!/bin/sh
        prefix=$(dirname $0)

        echo -n "Starting Apache test server..."
        /usr/sbin/httpd -d $prefix/../etc/httpd -f conf/httpd.conf
      </programlisting>
    </section>
    <section id="EditConfEnv">
      <title>Editing Configuration Files</title>
      <para>
        Now, your directory contains the same configuration files as the test 
        server. You need to customize them for your specific environment.
      </para>
      <section id="EditConfEnvApache">
        <title>Apache Configuration File</title>
        <para>
            You need to edit etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf for your test server. 
            Again, here are some guidelines, but beware that some parameters may 
            be different in your installation. For example, if you are using a 
            secure server (https), you will need to duplicate the key directories. 
            So you need to modify the following directives (and replace 'your_login' 
            by... your login):
        </para>
        <itemizedlist spacing="compact" mark="bullet">

        Sometimes, it might not be convenient to develop on the test server 
        itself, e.g. when you cannot directly edit source files (remote file system). 
        In this case you can also setup a development environment on another 
        machine (e.g. on your own desktop if it is a Linux Box). Please note, 
        however, that you have to be careful with some aspects:

      <itemizedlist spacing="compact" mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para>
            You might have to install and setup your own versions of PHP, Apache 
            and MySQL (you can also use the MySQL server located on the test server).

            If your setup is not exactly the same as the production server 
            (Linux, PHP or Apache versions), you will probably need to re-test 
            your code on the test server before committing your changes or updating 
            the production server.

            If you want to use the MySQL server located on the test server, you 
            need to make sure that MySQL is configured to accept connections from 
            your machine. This is an example of how MySQL could be configured.

        All &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; source files (PHP, Perl and shell scripts) are 
        located in the '/home/httpd' directory, or '~user/testserver/httpd' on 
        your development environment. In order to install the source code, you 
        should 'cd' in this directory, and checkout the sources there. We assume 
        that you have access to a SVN server containing the source code. 
        Otherwise, you can also simply copy the source code located in /home/httpd.

      <para>
        In order to checkout the source code of the CX_2_0_SUP branch, you may use the following command:

        The simplest solution is to use the same MySQL server running on the test

        Provided that the MySQL database server is running (it should be launched
