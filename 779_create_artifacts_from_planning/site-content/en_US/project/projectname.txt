<P>We now need some basic technical information for your project.
There are two types of names that will be associated with this project.

<P>The "Full Name" is descriptive, has no real name restrictions (except
a min of 3 characters and a max of 40 character limit), and
can be changed.</P>

<p>The project "Short Name" (also known as the "Group Name") has several restrictions. They are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>It cannot match the Short name of any other project
<LI>It must be between 3 and 30 characters in length
<LI>It can only contain characters, numbers, and dashes. NO SPACE.
</UL>

<P>In spite of these restrictions make it easy to remember because it will be used in several very visible places like the project web site or the CVS or Subversion repository.


<P>Please make your selections.

<P><B>Project Name</B></p>
