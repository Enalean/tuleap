<P><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> was created to promote collaborative software development and project management across <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> and to have one single
place where to shop for pieces of source code.

<p>To keep things simple, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> have put together a <a
href="<?php echo $exchangePolicyUrl ?>" target="side_window"><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Code eXchange
Policy</a> that defines the terms and conditions under which source
code can be shared inside <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?>.

<P>We think that this policy serves well the purpose of code sharing
while offering a good level of protection. However if this default
policy doesn't fit your needs select the item "Other" in the menu
below and let us know why you wish to use another policy. Your new
policy will be reviewed by the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Legal Department and the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team for approval.

<P>Choosing a new policy is a serious decision. Please take some time
to read the <a href="<?php echo $exchangePolicyUrl ?>"
target="side_window">default <?php echo $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Corporate Policy</a> before making a choice about
your project.

<P>
Remark: if you are applying for a website hosting-only project and do not
expect to host any source code on <?php print
$GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>, please select "website-only" from the
choices below and proceed.</p>

If you selected "other", please provide an explanation along
