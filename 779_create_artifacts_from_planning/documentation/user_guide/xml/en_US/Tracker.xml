  <title>Tracker (Legacy)</title>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Disclaimer:</emphasis> this chapter covers the legacy version (aka v3) of Tracker service.
  For documentation on the current tracker system (v5) see <xref linkend="TrackerV5Service" />.</para>

  <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker is one of the most powerful and versatile
  services offered to &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted projects. It allows for the tracking 
  of various artifacts like bugs, tasks, requirements, etc... and a 
  project can create as many trackers as necessary.</para>

  <para>All trackers, whether predefined at the site level or created
  by a project can be fully customized. </para>

  <section id="TrackerPrinciples">
    <title>Terminology and common features</title>

    <para>Before we explain the features of the tracker service, it's
    worth spending some time on the terminology used in the tracker
    service as well as on some of the features that are shared by all
    trackers.</para>

    <para>As the Tracker Service is meant to track virtually any kind
    of item, the generic term &#34;artifact&#34; will be used throughout this
    document to designate items that are being tracked - be it bug,
    task, support request or other such type.</para>

    <para>Defining a tracker is just a matter of assigning it a name,
    choosing the fields that are going to be used in the tracker,
    and what values will be allowed in those fields.</para>

    <para>In addition to the project definable fields and field values there
    are other fields that are permanently attached to a tracker
    artifact. These are:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

      <listitem>
	<para> <emphasis role="bold">Follow-up
	    comments</emphasis>: all artifacts have the full list of
	    free text comments posted by users attached to it.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">File attachment</emphasis>:
	    all artifacts can have any number of files attached to
	    it. File attachments generally contains supplementary
	    information that help better characterize the nature of
	    the artifact.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><emphasis role="bold">CC list</emphasis>: any number
	    of users can be notified of modification to an
	    artifact by including their &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; user name or email
	    address in the CC list.</para>
      </listitem>

    <title>Entering the Tracker Service</title>

    <para>To enter the Tracker service of a given project, first go to
    the Project Summary page (see <xref
	linkend="AccessingAProjectSummaryPage" />) and either click
    the &#34;Trackers&#34; item in the Project Main Menu located in the
    upper part of the page or you can directly choose a tracker from the
    trackers listed in the Public Area of the Project Summary page.</para>

    <para>You will be presented with a list of trackers available for
    this particular project (see <xref linkend="TrackerWelcomeScreen"
	/>. Select the tracker you are interested in. Entering the
    tracker will give you access to various tracker functions
    depending on the permissions you have with this tracker. You may
    be able to submit new artifacts, update existing ones, search
    and browse the artifact database or configure the tracker.</para>

  <section id="ArtifactSubmission">
    <title>New Artifact Submission</title>

    <para>To submit a new artifact to a given project you must first
    access the appropriate tracker of that project as indicated in the
    section above (see <xref linkend="EnteringtheTrackerService" />.</para>

    <para>When entering a given tracker you are presented with the
    artifact selection and browsing screen (more about this facility
    in <xref linkend="ArtifactBrowsing" />). For now let&#39;s click
    on the &#34;Submit a New Artifact&#34; item (or whatever the artifact
    name is) from the Tracker Menu Bar in the upper part of the welcome
    screen (see <xref linkend="FigureASampleTrackerBrowsingScreen"
	/>).</para>

    <figure id="ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheCodendiProject">
      <title>A sample artifact submission screen (the artifact is of type &#34;bug&#34; here)</title>

      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
	  <imagedata format="PNG"
	    fileref="../../screenshots/en_US/sc_artifactsubmission.png" width="14.5cm" />
	</imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para><xref linkend="ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheCodendiProject"
	/> shows a sample submission screen from one of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted
    projects. Because of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker high level of
    customizability no two submission screens look alike. Depending on
    the project more or less fields may appear on the tracker
    submission form and the name of artifact managed by the tracker
    may change as well.</para>

    <para>In the example provided on <xref
    linkend="ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheCodendiProject" /> the
    artifact type is a bug (also know as &#34;defect&#34; in corporate
    language). The user is asked to choose a bug Category, a bug
    Group, a Priority and an Assignee from a series of pull down
    menus. Then comes a one-line description for the bug and a longer
    text entry field where you can fully characterize the bug. After
    clicking on the Submit button, a unique ID is automatically
    assigned to the submitted artifact.</para>

    <para>When submitting a new artifact, make the Summary and the
    detailed description as explicit as possible.  Do not use a
    clueless summary like: &#34;Service X doesn&#39;t work&#34; or
    &#34;Blocking problem in Document Mgr&#34;. Explain the exact
    nature of the artifact by giving an explicit Summary and
    Description to the person in charge. A unique ID is automatically
    assigned to the submitted artifact.</para>

    <para>The values proposed by a field could depend upon other field value. If javascript is activated in your browser, fields will be filtered dynamically. Otherwise, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; will ensure that the values you submit are correct.</para>

    <para>As explained above, artifact submission forms vary from one
    project to another depending on the fields used by the
    tracker. The submission form can also vary according to the
    permission level. Depending whether you are a project member or an
    ordinary registered user the artifact fields displayed on the
    screen may differ. As an example, on <xref
    linkend="ArtifactSubmissionScreenFromTheCodendiProject" />, the bug
    submitter using the form is probably a project member because
    giving access to the &#34;Assigned to&#34; field to an ordinary
    registered user doesn&#39;t make much sense. It is very unlikely
    that users external to the project team know enough about the
    project organization to correctly assign the bug. That's the reason why 
    artifact fields shown to users on the submission form can be
    configured in the Tracker Administration module (see <xref
    linkend="TrackerAdministration" />)</para>

    <para>In any case don&#39;t forget to click on the
    &#34;Submit&#34; button when you are finished !</para>

    <para><tip><title>Tip: make sure your artifact hasn&#39;t yet been

    and Browsing facility or you can use the search box in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;

  </section>

  <section id="ArtifactBrowsing">
    <title>Artifact Browsing</title>

    <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers the ability to browse the artifact database
    according to a variable set of criteria.</para>

    <section id="ArtifactSelectionCriteria">
      <title>Selection Criteria</title>

      <para>The upper part of the artifact browsing screen is devoted to the
        selection criteria. <xref
	  linkend="FigureASampleTrackerBrowsingScreen" /> shows the
        default set of selection criteria that is available when a new tracker
        is created. You can select bugs by Category (the module in which the
        bug occurred), Group (nature of the bug like Crash, Documentation
        Typo, ...), Status (e.g. Open, Closed, ...) and Assignee (the person
        in charge of the bug). Other trackers may show more, less or different
        selection fields depending on the configuration put in place by the
        tracker administrators.</para>

      <para>How selection criteria are filled out depend on their
      field type. The Tracker Service currently has several the following types
      of fields used as search criteria:</para>

      <section id="ArtifactSelectBoxField">
	<title>Select Box Field</title>

	<para>A select box field can take its value in a set of
	predefined values. If you are using the simple search
	interface only one value can be selected at a time. If you
	want to select multiple values at once, use the Advanced Search
	facility.</para>

	<para>There might be 2 specific values in the list of choices:
	&#34;Any&#34; matches any value in the list and &#34;None&#34; matches the
	items where no value has been assigned yet</para>
      </section>

      <section id="ArtifactMultipleSelectBoxField">
	<title>Multiple Select Box Field</title>

	<para>A multiple select box field takes it's value from a set
	of predefined values. While the select box field introduced
	above only allows one to select only a single field value, the
	multiple select box field allows the user to select multiple
	values for the same field. In search mode it behaves exactly
	like the simple select box: if you are using the simple search
	interface only one value can be selected at a time. If you
	want to select multiple values at once, use the Advanced
	Search facility.</para>

	<para>There might be 2 specific values in the list of choices:
	&#34;Any&#34; matches any value in the list and &#34;None&#34; matches the
	items where no value has been assigned yet</para>
      </section>

      <section id="ArtifactTextField">
	<title>Text Field</title>

        <para>A Text field can contain any kind of text. There are two
        ways to query a text field:</para>


	<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

	  <listitem>
	    <para> <emphasis role="underline">Keyword
	    search</emphasis>: you can type a series of space
	    separated keywords that will ALL be searched for in the
	    text field (including as substring in
	    words)</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="underline">Regular
	    expression</emphasis>: You can also specify a <ulink
	    url="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html">MySQL
	    Extended Regular Expression</ulink> as a matching criteria
	    (mind the surrounding /.../ !)</para>

	    <para>Examples:</para>
	    <itemizedlist mark="dash" spacing="compact">
	      <listitem>
		<para>/^[Aa]ddition/ : matches any text field starting

      </section>

      <section id="ArtifactDateField">
	<title>Date Field</title>

	<para>A date criteria follows the following pattern:
	YYYY-MM-DD where YYYY is the year number, MM is the month
	number and DD is the day number.</para>

	<para>Examples: 1999-03-21 is March 21st, 1999, 2002-12-05 is
	Dec 5th, 2002. </para>

      </section>

      <section id="ArtifactIntegerField">
	<title>Integer Field</title>

	<para>An integer field can take positive or (possibly)
	negative values and has no decimal part.</para>

	<para>Examples: 0, 1, +2, -100&hellip;</para>

	<para>There are several ways to query an integer field. Here
	are the values you can specify in a integer query field:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para> <emphasis role="underline">Single

	    value (e.g. &gt; 120 , &lt; -30)</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><para><emphasis role="underline">Range</emphasis>:
	  if you use the &#34;integer1-integer2&#34; notation the search

      <title>Favorites and Predefined Tracker Queries</title>

      <para><tip><title>Tip: save and re-use your tracker queries</title><para>If
        you often run the same queries against a tracker with the same set of
        selection criteria, it is probably a good idea to save this query for
        later re-use. To do this: select the appropriate tracker report, then
        choose your search criteria, click on the &#34;Browse&#34; button to
        run the query. Finally click on the &#34;Bookmark this Page&#34; item
        in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu. A new bookmark will show up in your Personal
        Page. A click on this bookmark will run the exact same query again.</para></tip></para>

      <para>Your favorite queries can be saved via the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
      bookmark mechanism as explained in the Tip box but there are
      also shortcuts in the Tracker Menu Bar for the most common
      queries. They are:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis role="bold">Open Artifacts</emphasis>: display all the
            artifacts that are not yet closed for this project.</para>

            using)</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Also notice that &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; always keeps track of the last run
      query. Next time you enter the tracker welcome screen, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; will
      use the same set of selection criteria in the selection fields
      and display the list of matching artifacts accordingly.</para>

      <section id="TrackerAdvancedSearchMode">
	<title>Advanced Search Mode</title>

	<para>At any time during the search phase, you can toggle the search
          mode from Simple to Advanced and vice-versa (see the Advanced Search
          link). The Advance Search mode allows you to select multiple values
          for each selection criteria. Using this mode you could search for
          both open and suspended bugs assigned to project members A and B.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="TrackerSearchResults">
      <title>Tracker Search Results</title> 
      
      <para>Based on your selection of search criteria, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; runs a
      query against the tracker database, selects the matching
      artifacts, and displays them right below the selection
      criteria. Columns displayed in the artifact list are entirely
      configurable by the project team (see <xref
	  linkend="TrackerReports" />). Therefore, the artifact browsing
      screen might look completely different from the one shown in
      <xref linkend="FigureASampleTrackerBrowsingScreen" />.</para>

      <para>Artifact severity is color coded. Colors associated with
      severity levels may vary from one &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site to another and it
      is therefore shown at the bottom of the list of results generated
      by the search.  Finally, results are listed by chunks of N
      artifacts where N is user-definable. If more than N artifacts
      are retrieved from the tracker database you are invited to click
      on the navigation bar to display the next or previous chunk of
      artifacts.</para>

      <para>To access a given artifact from the list of results,
      simply click on the corresponding &#34;Artifact ID&#34;.</para>

      <section id="ArtifactListSorting">
	<title>Artifact List Sorting</title>

	<para>By default, artifacts are sorted by ID which happens to
	be the chronological order in which they have been submitted
	and stored in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; database.</para>

	<para>The list of artifacts can be sorted by any of the
	columns displayed on the screen by clicking on the column
	heading. Clicking twice on the same heading toggles the sort
	order between ascending to descending.  The currently displayed
        sorting direction is shown by a small up or down arrow next to
	the sort criteria right above the artifact list. One exception
	to this rule is for sorting by Severity. Severity being shown
	as a color code and not as a column per se, there is a special
	link at the bottom of the screen to sort the list of results
	by Severity.</para>

	<para>For more sophisticated sorting you can also activate the
	multi-column sort.  In this mode sort criteria accumulates as
	you click on column headings.  So you can for instance click
	&#34;Severity&#34; first and &#34;Assigned To&#34; second to see who in the
	team is assigned critical bugs and how many.At any point in
	the multi-column sort process, a click on one of the sort
	criteria displayed in the list (criteria 1 > criteria 2 >
	criteria 3...)  will bring you backward in the sort criteria
	list. Using this feature you can easily test various sorting
	strategies.</para>

	<note><para>Note:Sorting criteria, like selection criteria,
	are also saved into your preferences and the same sorting
	criterion is re-used in subsequent queries.</para></note>

      </section>

    
      <section id="ExportSearchResults">
	<title>Export Tracker Search Results</title>
	<para>At the bottom of the Search Result screen you have a button

      <section id="ArtifactPrinterFriendlyVersion">
	<title>Printer Friendly Version</title>

	<para>At any point in the process of browsing the tracker

	<title>Tracker Reports</title>

	<para>Tracker reports allow for the definition of a specific
	layout of the artifact search and browsing screen where one
	can choose the selection criteria and the columns used in the
	list of matching artifacts. Depending on the project, users
	may enjoy the ability to choose from several tracker reports
	by using the upper pull-down menu of the artifact browsing
	screen. If no project or user specific tracker report has been
	defined, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; &#39;Default&#39; report is the only one

  <section id="ArtifactUpdate">
    <title>Artifact Update</title>

    <para>Selecting an artifact ID from the list generated by
    a search operation will bring you to a screen with all the artifact
    details. Depending on the permissions you have on this tracker 
    (see <xref linkend="FieldPermissionsManagement" />), the 
    detailed view is made of text fields and menus that you
    can update with new values. If you are an
    anonymous user or a registered user who does not belong to the
    project team, most of the fields will likely appear as immutable
    text. By default, non-project members cannot edit any of the artifact
    fields. They can only submit a follow-up comment, add themselves

    <para>The Artifact Update screen is divided in several parts:
    <emphasis role="bold">Header, Comments, CC List, Artifact
    Attachments, Dependencies and History.</emphasis></para>

    <section id="ArtifactHeaders">
      <title>Header</title>

      <para>The header zone is where you&#39;ll find all the fields
      associated with an artifact. As shown on <xref
      linkend="FigureHeaderOfArtifactUpdateScreen" />, many of these
      fields are assigned a set of predefined values (Status,
      Category, Resolution) while some others have a number format
      (Effort) or a free text format (Summary). For more clarity, 
      the fields are grouped in field sets.
      The set of fields used in a given tracker, as well as the related set of predefined
      values and the field sets can be configured by project members who have
      administration permissions on this tracker. (see <xref
      linkend="TrackerAdministration" /> for more details on the
      Tracker configuration).</para>

    <section id="ArtifactComments">
      <title>Comments</title>

      <para>As many follow-up comments as needed can be attached to
      any given artifact. Follow-up comments are free text fields
      where virtually any kind of information or comment can be typed
      in.</para>

      <para>Follow-up comments have several of interesting capabilities and extensions:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis role="bold">Canned Responses</emphasis>: it
	  is not infrequent to see the project members in charge of
	  the artifact classification and dispatch process to post the
	  same follow-up comments again and again. Typical examples of
	  repeatedly posted comments are: a thank you message to the
	  originator, a request for the originator to provide commonly
	  missing information like version numbers or type of machine
	  used, etc. Rather than typing the same comments all the
	  time, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; allows project members to create a predefined
	  set of responses. Each canned response is defined by a name
	  and by the body of the response.</para>

	  <para>Posting a canned response is just a matter of
	  selecting the appropriate response from the pull down menu
	  in the artifact update screen and submitting the
	  changes. Defining a new Canned Response can be done on the
	  fly from the artifact update form by clicking on the
	  &#34;define a new Canned Response&#34; link.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis role="bold">Comment Types</emphasis>: in
	  order to avoid the exponential growth of new artifact fields
	  to store all sorts of free text information, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers an
	  interesting mechanism called Comment Types. The project team
	  has the ability to define a list of labels that can be used
	  to characterize the nature of a follow-up comment. This is a
	  very helpful feature to define the nature of the information
	  contained in a follow-up comment and to quickly identify
	  these comments in the long list of follow-up
	  comments. Typical examples of such comment types are: 
	  &#34;Workaround&#34; for a comment where you explain how to
	  work around a bug, &#34;Impacted Files&#34; to give the list
	  of source files impacted by the bug resolution (assuming
	  your artifacts are bugs), &#34;Test case&#34; to document
	  how to test the code in the future to make sure that this
	  case will be tested in the future test suite, etc. Comment
	  types are defined in the Tracker Administration module (see
	  <xref linkend="TrackerAdministration" />)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis role="bold">Cross-References</emphasis>:
	  while typing a follow-up comment, you can use some special
	  text pattern to refer to other artifacts, documents, files, or CVS or
	  Subversion commits.  These pattern will be automatically
	  displayed as hyperlinks when the follow-up comment is
	  displayed on the screen. This is an extremely powerful and
	  easy to use mechanism that is covered in more details in
	  <xref linkend="ArtifactCrossReferencing" />.</para>
	</listitem>

    <section id="ArtifactCCList">
      <title>CC List</title>

      <para>As explained later in this chapter (see <xref
	  linkend="TrackerEmailNotification" />) Tracker offers
      a powerful email notification system for those users who, at
      some point, were involved in the life of the artifact whether as
      a submitter, an assignee or as a person who posted a follow-up
      comment (commenter).</para>

      <para>Sometimes it is however helpful to involve other people in
      the email notification process even if they did not play an
      explicit role in the life of the artifact so far. For instance,
      you may want a QA contact or the originator of the artifact when
      different from the submitter to receive a carbon-copy (CC) of
      the email notifications. This is precisely what the CC List is
      intended for. Inserting CC names in the CC list will allow these
      people to receive updates notifications for this specific
      artifact.</para>

      <section id="ArtifactCCNames">
        <title>CC Names</title>

        <para>The CC names can be either email addresses or a
        &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; login name if the user has a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; account.</para>

            the ability to customize the kind of update events they

            as login names, CC names added in the form of email
            addresses have no customization capabilities and

        <para>Several CC names can be added at once by separating them
        with commas or semi-column in the &#34;Add CC&#34; field. Using the
        comment field, one can also explain why these CC names were

            address in any &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; projects. In other words a &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; user

    <section id="ArtifactAttachments">
      <title>Artifact Attachments</title>

      <para>In addition to comments, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker 
      allows you to attach virtually any piece of information to an artifact
      in the form of a file. Typical examples of artifact attachments are
      application screen shots in PNG, GIF, JPEG or whatever image
      format is appropriate; it can also be core dumps, a binary image
      of program that crashed or even a simple text file showing a
      stack trace or an error message.</para>

      <para>Artifact attachments can be of any type (image, video,
      sound, text, binary&hellip;) and a comment field can be
      optionally used to annotate the attachment. The maximum size of
      a file attachment is site dependent. The default is 2
      MByte.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="ArtifactDependencies">
      <title>Artifact Dependencies</title>

      <para>The next section on the artifact update screen deals with
      artifact dependencies (see <xref
	  linkend="FigureArtifactDependencies" />). Users have the
      ability to establish a dependency link from an artifact to one
      or several other artifacts belonging to any of the tracker of
      any &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; project. This is made possible by the fact that
      artifacts have a unique ID across the entire &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
      system.</para>

      <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; system does not impose any semantic on the
      nature of these dependency links. As a project team, you are
      free to agree on a specific meaning for these links. It can be a
      cause-effect type of relationship, a duplication of information
      or a time dependency for a task tracker.</para>

      <para>To create an artifact dependency, type one or
      several artifact IDs (comma separated) and submit the form. The
      cross-referenced artifacts appear in a table right below the
      input field showing their description as well as the tracker and
      the project they belong to.</para>

      <para>To delete an artifact dependency simply click on the
      wastebasket icon to the right of the artifact description line
      and confirm or cancel when asked by the dialog box.</para>

      <para>The dependency section shows the artifact dependencies in
      both ways: it shows the list of artifact(s)
      the displayed artifact depends on but also the list of artifacts
      that depend upon the one you are browsing.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="ArtifactCrossReferencing">
      <title>Artifact Cross-Referencing</title>

      <para>In addition to the rather formal way of expressing a
      dependency between two artifacts presented in
      <xref linkend="ArtifactDependencies"/>, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers the ability to
      cross-reference any artifact, or any other &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; object from within a follow-up
      comment.</para>

      <para>When typing a follow-up comment, any text that follows the
      pattern &#34;XXX #NNN&#34; will be interpreted as a reference to the
      artifact XXX number NNN, where NNN is the unique artifact ID, and XXX is the 
      tracker short name (e.g. &#34;bug #123&#34;, &#34;task #321&#34;,
      &#34;req #12&#34;, etc.).
      If you don't know the tracker short name or don't want to specify it, you
      may simply use  &#34;art #NNN&#34;.
      Each time &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; displays a piece of text that follows this pattern it will
      auto-magically create an hyperlink to the web page showing all
      the details of the artifact.</para>

      <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; reference patterns may be used to reference artifacts, as well as source
      code commits, documents, files, etc. Please refer to 
      <xref linkend="ReferenceOverview" /> for more details on References.</para>

      <para>Furthemore references concerning artifacts, svn revisions and

    <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; provides project and tracker administrators with the
    possibility to update several artifacts in one step: delete/add
    the same CC name entry or file attachment to a set of artifacts,
    assign a list of artifacts to a person, etc... A typical
    application of the mass update feature is when a person leaves a
    project and all the artifacts that are assigned to her have to be
    re-affected to another person.</para>

      <section id="MassChangeSelectionCriteria">
        <title>Selection Criteria</title>

        <para>The artifacts to be updated can be selected according
        to a set of criteria. These criteria are the same as for artifact
        browsing. For fine-grained control you may also select individually 
        all artifacts concerned by the mass change. Please see the
        <xref linkend="AccessingAProjectSummaryPage" />
        for more detail on how to fill out the selection criteria.</para>
	<para>In the sample screen in <xref linkend="MassChangeSelection" /> 
	hitting the left button "Mass Change Selected Items" will select
	the three items checked individually, hitting the right button
	"Mass Change All Items" will select all nine items corresponding to
	the selection criteria. </para>

        <para>Once you have selected all the artifacts to be updated you can
        now proceed to affect these changes via the Update screen. The Update 
        screen for the Mass Change is very similar to the normal Artifact 
        Update screen. It is divided into the following parts: Header, Comments, 
        CC List, Artifact Attachments, and Dependencies.</para>

        <para>In the Header zone you find all the fields associated to the
        artifact. Only those that are changed from Unchanged to a defined
        value will be taken into account for the update. In our example in
	<xref linkend="MassChangeUpdateHeader" /> only the "Assigned to" field
	of the three artifacts will be updated to a new value. All other
        fields remain unchanged. </para>

        <para>The CC List zone differs from the normal Artifact CC List zone
        in that it contains all the CC names of the selected artifacts
        with the information of in how many artifacts a CC name is used. If
	you add a CC Name it will be added to all the three artifacts. In our
	example in <xref linkend="MassChangeUpdateCC" />, there is one CC 
	Name used in one of the three selected artifacts.
	By checking the "Delete?" box, the given CC Name will be deleted from 
	this artifact.</para>

        <para>Equally, the Attachment zone contains any files attached
        to the selected artifacts with the information as to how many of those
        artifacts each file is attached to. The Dependencies zone is 
        structured in the same manner.</para>

	<para>Each mass change is tracked in the project history

      <para>If artifact duplication is allowed for the tracker (see section 
      <xref linkend="TrackerGeneralSettings" />), 
      project members can duplicate an artifact. To duplicate an artifact, 
      select an existing artifact (as though you want to update it) and click 
      the "Copy this artifact" link. Then, you are in an artifact submission 
      screen, with all the values of the duplicated artifact. As summary must be 
      unique, a copy information is just appended to the original summary.
      By default, a follow-up comment is pre-filled with an indication of the 
      duplication, and a dependent is also pre-filled with a reference to the 
      original artifact.
      Of course, you are free to modify the values of the duplicated artifact.</para>

  <section id="TrackerEmailNotification">
    <title>E-mail Notification</title>

    <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker is equipped with a powerful and flexible
    e-mail notification system. Unless otherwise instructed by the
    project administrators or the users themselves, the e-mail
    notification system follows simple default rules. Whenever an
    artifact is created or updated - whether with an additional
    follow-up comment, a new attachment or a change in any of the
    artifact fields - an e-mail message is sent to the following
    actors:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
	<para>The artifact submitter (the person who initially submitted the artifact)</para>

	<para>All users who posted at least one follow-up comment to
	the artifact.</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>Beside these simple rules, the Administration module of the
    &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker allows &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users to customize the email notification
    process. For further information see <xref

    <para>The e-mail message generated by the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker first
    shows the most recent changes that occurred on the artifact in
    case of an update. It is then followed by a complete snapshot of
    the artifact. Web pointers are also included in the message to
    quickly and easily access the artifact form on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="ArtifactImport">

      <para>Project Administrators have the means to import
    artifacts into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; trackers using the well known
    CSV (Comma Separated Value) format supported by all

      <title>CSV File Parsing</title>
	<para>The CSV format that is accepted as import input 
	is accessible over the CSV file submission screen. 
	This page allows manual validation of the tracker 
	field labels, indicating which fields are mandatory in
      	case of a new artifact submission. In addition, it gives
      	you a sample CSV file.
        As for the export feature, you can specify the separator
        used in the CSV file you want to import as well as the date format 
        (See <xref linkend="UserPreferences" />).
        If you already use the Tracker
      	Artifact Export (see <xref linkend="ProjectDataExport" />)
      	you will notice that the format of the files to import
      	and the exported files are exactly the same. 
        This means that if you changed your CSV separator for exporting 
        data, you must use the same to import those data.
        You can refer to the export format especially
      	for the date formats as well as the format of the
      	follow-up comments (see <xref linkend="ArtifactComments" />).
      	The first record in the CSV import file is always the 
      	header row containing all the tracker field labels that 
      	will be used in the following artifact records.</para>

    	<para>Depending on whether you want to import new artifacts
      	or update the ones that already exist in the tracker you
      	need to provide different information. Nevertheless,
      	you can mix in one CSV file the submission of new artifacts
      	and the update of existing ones.</para>
     
    	<para>For the artifact creation you need to provide
      	information on all fields that are specified
      	as mandatory in the CSV import format except the Artifact 
	ID which must not be specified. You may omit
      	the submitter and submission date. The artifact
      	submitter is then automatically set to the
      	user importing the CSV file and the submission date
      	will be the date of the import.</para>

    	<para>For the artifact update you need to provide the
      	artifact identifier of the artifacts to update. Beside
      	this, you only need to provide the fields you want
      	to update. All fields not specified in the CSV file 
	will remain unchanged.</para>

    	<para>The parsing method checks several potential errors 
	in the CSV file:
 	<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
	<listitem><para>Omission of mandatory fields when submitting
	new artifacts </para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Not the same number of columns in the header 
	row and a artifact row</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Unknown tracker field label</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Field values that do not correspond to the 
	predefined field values of a (multi) select box field
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Double submission (i.e. submission of a new 
	artifact with exactly the same summary as an existing
	artifact)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Unknown artifact identifier</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Remove already submitted follow-up comments
        </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	All other potential errors have to be checked manually
	by looking at the parse report table.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section>
	<title>The Database Update</title>

	<para>If you import new artifacts, all 
	non-mandatory fields that are omitted in the CSV 
	file will be initialized to their default value.</para>
	
	<para>If you want to update the CC list or
      	dependencies list of an existing artifact, be aware 
	that the import will delete all former CC names or 
	dependencies of the artifact and put the CC names 
	or dependencies from the import file instead.
	All follow-up comments in the csv file that had already 
	been posted are removed to avoid double
	submission.
	The submitter and submission date of an existing
	artifact is never changed by an import even if the
	import file contains relevant information.</para>

	<para>If an error occurs for some artifact during 
	the database update the following artifacts in the CSV
	file are not imported any more.</para>

	<para>Each import is tracked in the project history 
	(<xref linkend="ProjectHistory" />). On the other
	hand, no e-mail notification is sent in response to 
	the import.</para>

    <para><tip id="ExcelAndRegionals"><title>Tip: Excel and Regionals</title>
    <para>
    If a .csv file is opened in Excel, any change to the spreadsheet 
    (even something as simple as a column resizing) may cause 
    Excel to modify and update the .csv file. Changes that may 
    occur include: dates, times and numbers converted to 
	the same format as those used by your system's regional 
	settings, single line feeds converted to line feed 
	and carriage return, extra commas appended to certain lines.
    </para>
	
    <para>
    The updated date format might not be compatible with the 
    &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; date format and potentially cause troubles when 
    importing such updated CSV files back into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;.
    On the other hand &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;-exported CSV files might not open correctly
    under Excel in certain Regionals.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    If you have a .csv file that either will not open correctly under 
    Excel or was opened in Excel and will not import 
	into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; please try the following:
	Make sure all applications are closed. Change your system's 
        regional settings (Start > Settings > Control Panel > Regional 
	Options) to use the English with the following formats: 
	Date = MM/dd/YYYY Time = hh:mm. Using Excel, open the 
	.csv files that don't import, make a column width change, 
	save the files and exit Excel. Go back and restore your 
	original regional settings. Import the "fixed" .csv file into &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;.

    <para>The next step is to decide upon the set of fields
      available for this tracker. In order to avoid the pain of
      defining the most common type of trackers again and again
      (e.g. Bug tracker, Support Request tracker, etc.) &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers
      the ability to create a new tracker from a set of
      templates. Those templates are either &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;-wide templates (also
      known as site templates) or project specific templates.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Remark</emphasis>: using a template

	Each of those templates have predefined fields that correspond

	the following, we give a short overview of these different
	work processes. For each of those templates, the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team
	also tried to maintain a fair balance between sophistication
	and ease of use. As a consequence, fairly simple and
	straightforward templates are configured by default for all
	new hosted projects. Then it is up to the project members to
	decide how much information they want to see attached to an
	artifact and customize their tracker configuration
	accordingly.

    <section id="BugTemplate">
      <title>The Bug Tracker Template</title> 

      <para>One of the golden rules in a collaborative project

      <para>The template Bug Tracker comes pre-configured with a set
      of fields (used or not) that are probably enough for the
      majority of projects hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. You can either decide that
      the template is lacking some critical fields that you can create

      that submitted patches are available to anybody at all time
      regardless of the final decision of the project team. Therefore

      <para>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users who have access to the tracker can follow the

      <para>The Scrum Backlog tracker contains artifacts called "User Stories", that

      define the customer value of each story, its acceptance criteria, its
      effort, its current backlog (Product Backlog or Sprint Backlog), etc.
      </para>
    
      <para>Other optional fields are available, and of course, each project may
      customize the tracker to fit the way it implements the methodology</para>

      <para>At the beginning of a Scrum project, each customer user story must 
      be stored in the Product Backlog ('Backlog' field of the tracker). During
      the first Sprint Meeting, a few stories are selected by the team to be implemented 
      in the first iteration. They are moved to the "Sprint Backlog" ('Backlog' field),
      and evaluated ('Initial Effort'), or even duplicated into smaller stories.
      The team then affects the stories to team members ('Owner') and can start 
      developing.</para>
     
      <para>At the end of the Sprint (after two to four weeks), the team meets

      groups of users.</para>

      <section id="TrackerAndArtifactPermissionsManagement">
        <title>Tracker and Artifacts Permissions Management</title>

        <para>When entering this module, a list of user groups appears
        along with their access permissions. The user group list first
        shows groups of users defined at the system level like
        all_users, registered_users, project_members, etc. These are
        groups that &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; manages for you so you don't have to keep
        them up to date when new users subscribe to the site or become
        member of your project. The second part of the user group list
        shows all groups of users defined at the project level (see

        define and manage groups of users).</para>

        <para>Each group can be associated with the following access

	  <para>As an example of how you can use these permissions
	  let's assume that you have created a tracker where several
	  of your customers can report defects on your software. In
	  such a situation, you may decide that a customer from a
	  given company should only see those defects that were
	  submitted by its employees and not those submitted by other
	  companies.</para>

	  <para>To achieve this you just need to create a group called
	  'company_A' in which you include the login names of all the
	  users working for company A. Then do the same with the group
	  'company_B' for company B. Those two groups will then be
	  given the 'access to artifacts submitted by group' type of
	  permission. In addition you probably want to grant 'access
	  to all artifacts' to the project members or to the
	  'tracker_administrators' groups so that your team members can
	  manage artifacts from any customer.</para>

          <para>In this example:</para>

      <section id="FieldPermissionsManagement">
        <title>Field Permissions Management</title>

        <para>Beside defining access permissions for the tracker and
        its artifacts (see <xref
        linkend="TrackerAndArtifactPermissionsManagement"/>) it is
        sometimes necessary to restrict access to certain fields of
        the tracker to a given population. As an example if you share
        a defect tracking system with your customers you may want to
        hide some fields from the view of your customer or prevent
        them from modifying certain fields. This is precisely what
        this module is meant for.</para>

        
        <para>When using this configuration module, you can toggle the
        display between two different views: you can either view all
        user groups permissions for a given field OR for a given user
        group you can view all the field permissions defined for
        it. The experience shows that the view by field is often the
        preferred one when you configure a tracker for the first time
        whereas the view by group of users is more convenient to
        adjust the permission settings later on (see <xref
        linkend="UserGroups" /> for more information on how to define
        and manage groups of users).</para>

        <para>Each group of users can be granted the following
        permissions for a given field:</para>

        <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

  	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Can submit</emphasis>: this
	    permission determines whether a group of users can define
	    the initial value of a field when an artifact is first
	    submitted. If not checked, this field will not be visible
	    on the submission screen for this user group.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Read-only</emphasis>: if
	    granted read-only permission a group of users only has
	    read access to a field. In other words the users see the
	    value of the field but cannot modify it.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Update</emphasis>: if granted

	  </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Important Note</emphasis>: the
        permissions associated with a field apply in many areas of a
        tracker. For instance if a group of users has no access to a
        given field, this field becomes invisible on the initial
        submission form, on the artifact search form as well as in the
        table of results returned by the search, in the artifact
        update form, in the history of changes associated with each
        artifact and finally in the email notification sent to this
        group of users.</para>

      <title>Field Sets Management</title>

      <para>In order to improve the input of the artifact submission form, 
      the fields of the trackers are grouped in field sets.
      This allows to open up the submission form, or to clusterize fields that have 
      same semantics, or also to group fields that play a particular part 
      (for instance, you could clusterize fields aimed to be filled by the one who is
      responsible for the diagnosis of the artifact, and then group fields aimed to be filled
      by the one who is in charge of fixing it, etc.).
      </para>

      <para>One frequently sees project members in

      <para>Rather than repeatedly typing the same follow-up

	selecting the appropriate response from the pull down menu in
	the artifact update form.</para>

      <para>Also note that defining a new Canned Response can be

      <para>Knowing that project administrators, project members and other
        &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users may have different needs in searching the tracker 
        database, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offers the ability to define project or user specific
        tracker reports.</para>

      <para>Creating a tracker report consists in deciding what fields
      you want to use as search criteria and what fields you want to
      see in the columns of the table where the results of the search
      are presented. You can also define the order in which the search
      criteria and the columns will appear on the screen.</para>

      <para>Tracker Administrators have the ability to define tracker
      reports that will be usable by all registered users who have
      access to the tracker whereas all other users can
      only define reports for their personal use.</para>

      <para><tip><title>Tip: Tracker Reports specifies the report layout
      not the report content</title><para>While configuring Tracker
      reports you will probably notice that the configuration screen
      allows you to define the fields that you are going to use a
      search criteria but not the values of this search criteria. This
      is on purpose. Defining a report template and filling out the
      search template with content (values) are 2 distinct operations
      on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;. Once a report template has been defined in the
      administration module (e.g &#39;Simple Report&#39;, &#39;QA
      report&#39;, &#39;Daily report&#39; ...)  you can go to the
      tracker searching and browsing module and use the report
      template for all sorts of queries. Select the report you want
      from the pull-down menu, fill out the search form with the
      values you are interested in and click on the browse
      button. Then you can save the entire query (report plus values)
      with the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; bookmarking mechanism (see tip in <xref

      <para>As explained earlier in <xref
	  linkend="TrackerEmailNotification" /> Tracker comes
      with a predefined set of rules to keep relevant people aware of
      the artifact life. The default rules can however be complemented
      or tuned in a number of ways:</para>

      <section id="TrackerGlobalEmailNotification">
	<title>Global Email Notification</title>

	<para>In addition to the default notification rules, the
	tracker administrators have the ability to specify a list of
	comma separated email addresses to which submissions of new
	artifacts (and optionally artifact updates) will be
	systematically sent. Note that in this case notifications will
	be sent to users regardless of their personal preferences
	defined (see section &#34;<xref
	linkend="TrackerEventRoleBasedEmailNotification" />&#34;
	below).</para>
    
    <para>You can choose to disable the permission check for global 
    email notification.
    This can be useful if the email address is a mailing list,
    because individual permissions can't be checked for each
    member of the mailing list. So for mailing lists, if the check box
    "check permissions" is checked, the notifications will be send to each 
    member with the permissions of an anonymous user.
    </para>

	<para>This feature is typically used to send submissions of
	new artifacts to a number of well identified persons in the
	team who are in charge of qualifying and dispatching the
	artifacts.</para>

	    <title>Tip: Create a Distribution List to notify several people</title>

	  distribution lists (see <xref linkend="MailingLists"

	  address in the Global Email Notification field.</para>

	    <para>Creating a Mailing List on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; has several
	  advantages: first individuals can (un)subscribe by

	<para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker offers to all project members the

	    name in the Watchers field of the backup person when
	    the team member quits and remove it when the team member
	    returns.</para>

	    <para>As soon as you specify a person name in the

	    notification of this person and you can act accordingly on her
	    behalf.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>

	<title>Event/Role Based Notification Settings</title>

	<para>This is the most sophisticated part of the customization
	process. It allows any user to specify what types of events
	they wants to be notified of by email. Note that these settings
	are project and user specific so you can tune your own email
	notification preferences for each tracker you are involved
	with.</para>

	<para>The customization matrix (see <xref
	    linkend="FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix" />) presents you with a
	series of check boxes. Each check box allows you to specify
	what kind of events you want to be aware of depending on
	the role you play with respect to the artifact.</para>

	<para>There are 4 roles defined with respect to an artifact:</para>

	<itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Submitter</emphasis>: you are
	    the person who initially reported the artifact by filling
	    out the artifact submission form.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Assignee</emphasis>: you were
	    assigned the artifact and you are therefore responsible
	    for managing it.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">CC</emphasis>: you are
	    mentioned in the list of CC names (see <xref
	    linkend="ArtifactCCList" />).</para>
	  </listitem>
	  
	  <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis role="bold">Commenter</emphasis>: you have
	    once posted a follow-up comment in the artifact.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>For each of these roles you can instruct the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;
	Tracker to send email notifications to you only when some
	specific events occur. Nine different events (see the right
	most column on <xref linkend="FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix"
	    />) are monitored by the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Tracker. The description of the
	events is self explanatory and only appeal one comment: the
	first 8 events in the list can only occur on artifact
	updates. Only the last event relates to the submission of a
	new artifact.</para>

	<para>Let's review the sample matrix shown on <xref
	    linkend="FigureTrackerNotificationMatrix" /> and see, step by
	step, how this user has configured her notification
	settings:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>First let's look at the Commenter
	  column. The Commenter column says that this user has decided
	  that if she is involved in an artifact as a Commenter (she just
	  posted a follow-up comment at some point in time) then she is
	   only interested in receiving email notification when the
	  status of the artifact goes to &#34;Closed&#34; or when any of the fields
	  Priority, Status and Severity is modified. All other events
	  will be ignored by the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; tracker and no notification
	  will be sent to this user.</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>Second, looking at the matrix by row, one
	  can see that the user said that when she makes a
	  modification to an artifact herself (Event &#34;I am the
	  author of the change&#34;) she doesn't want to receive any
	  email notification whatever their role in this artifact
	  is. Please note that the event &#34;I am the author of the
	  change&#34; overlaps with other events. So in our example,
	  the submitter will not get a notification when she adds a new
	  artifact. Even if the event &#34;A new artifact has been
	  submitted&#34; is marked</para></listitem>

	  <listitem>
            <para>Finally, the user also said that when a new artifact
            is submitted to the project and is immediately assigned to
            her (Assignee role), she wants to be notified. However if
            she is the submitter of the new artifact then she is not
            interested in receiving the notification.</para>

	    <para>Note that the Commenter role is meaningless for the
	    event &#34;A new artifact has been submitted&#34; because
	    follow-up comments can only be added at update time not at
	    creation time. Also, the event &#34;I'm added or removed
	    from this role&#34; is meaningless for the Submitter and
	    the Commenter because these roles can not be modified in
	    an artefact.</para>
	  </listitem>

	</itemizedlist>

      <section id="ToggleEmailNotification">
	<title>Suspend Email Notification</title>

	<para>Sometimes, it can be convenient to suspend all email
        notifications for one specific tracker, for instance during 
        maintenance tasks. By selecting this option, 
        a tracker administrator disables both global notifications and
        event/role notifications.</para>

	<para>This feature is typically used when doing mass-changes 
        or for testing purposes.</para>
