      <title>Main Menu</title>

      <para>The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; main menu is a permanent piece of information that
      you&#39;ll always see on your screen wherever you are in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site.
      Its content can vary according to where you and who you are. In other
      words it is context sensitive. Let&#39;s take 2 examples:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                    spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>If you are visiting the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site as an anonymous user the
          upper part of the menu invites you to login or to create a new
          account whereas if you are logged in you&#39;ll be given access to
          other functions like Logout, Account Maintenance, Personal Page,
          etc.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Similarly if you decide to visit a given project
          hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;, the menu at the top of the screen will also
          show you the list of services available for this
          project.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In the rest of this section we only review those items that are
      permanent and context independent. Other menu items are described later
      in the document in the related service description.</para>

      <section id="SoftwareMap">
        <title>Software Map (or Project Tree)</title>

        <para>The Software Map is a pivotal service in &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; that you can
        (should) use to determine if there are some pieces of software that
        you can re-use for your own work. The Software Map is one of the 2
        ways by which you can search for existing software projects. The other
        one relies on the Search Facility.</para>

        <para>When a project is created it is classified by the project
        creator according to 7 criteria:</para>

        <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                      spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Development Status</emphasis>: How
            mature your project is (alpha, beta, stable,...)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Environment</emphasis>: in which
            environment your software is being used (Web, Win32, X Window,
            text mode,...)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Audience</emphasis>: The target
            audience of your software (developers, end-users, system
            administrators,...)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">License</emphasis>: License of
            your software. In most cases this is going to be the
            &SYS_ORG_NAME; Code exchange Policy</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Operating System</emphasis>: Operating
            system(s) your software runs on</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Programming Languages</emphasis>: the
            programming languages you used to develop your software</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Topic</emphasis>: The field of use of
            your project. This criteria describes the area in which your
            software operates (Printing, Scanning, Information Technology,...)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Each criterion can have up to 3 values for a given project (e.g.
        you can select up to 3 programming languages for a given project).
        Values of the various criteria are taken from a list of predefined
        values defined by the site administrator. The &#34;Topic&#34;
        criterion reflects the domain covered by your project (Printing,
        Scanning, Information Technology, etc.) and it follows a hierarchy of
        domains and sub-domains that the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team constantly refines as more
        projects are coming.</para>

        <para>Using the Software Map you can browse &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; hosted projects
        according to any of these criteria. As you explore the map, projects
        matching the criteria are listed on the screen with their name,
        description, creation date, activity percentile, and other
        information. The values of the 7 criteria for a given project are
        listed right after the project name and description. Notice that next
        to each criteria value is a [Filter] hyperlink. Clicking on any of
        these filters will result in restricting the project list to those
        that match the filter. &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; project templates or test projects 
	(see <xref linkend="ProjectType" />) are not listed in the Software Map.</para>

        <para>A Software Map browsing sample is shown on <xref
        linkend="FigureSoftwareMapSampleBrowsing" />. In this example, the
        user has first opened the Programming Languages Criteria and then
        selected C as a language of choice. This probably led to a large
        number of projects and so she then decided to narrow the set of
        projects by specifying 2 additional filters: the first one specifies
        that the Development Status must be Production-Stable and the second
        one requires that the projects runs on the SunOS/Solaris operating
        system.</para>

        <para>As a result of this multi-criteria screening, the user ends up
        with a list of 9 projects (only the first one is shown on <xref
        linkend="FigureSoftwareMapSampleBrowsing" /> to save space). Filters
        have another interesting property: they are sticky. It means that if
        you decide to browse the projects from another angle (say by opening
        the Topic folder), the selected filters will constantly apply. In
        order to release the search constraint you must explicitly remove the
        filter by clicking on the [Remove this Filter] link in the upper part
        of the screen.</para>

        <para><tip><title>TIP</title><para>If you repeatedly execute the same
        browsing operation on the Software Map you can save it in your
        Personal Page. To do this, first execute your software map request as
        explained above and when you are happy with the selection criteria,
        click on the Bookmark This Page item in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu. This will
        make a new link appear in your Personal Page that you can then edit to
        give it an appropriate description.</para></tip></para>

      <section id="TheCodeSnippetLibrary">
        <title>Code Snippet Library</title>

        <para>A project hosted on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; has the ability to use a large
        spectrum of services. However not all pieces of software worth sharing
        require such a rich environment. Sharing a very short piece of source
        code like a macro, a function or a shell script has to be quick and
        easy. This is precisely the role of the Code Snippet Library.</para>

        <para>The Code Snippet Library can be accessed via the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main Menu
        on the left hand side of the screen under the Software section (see
        <xref linkend="FigureTheCodendiHomePage" />)</para>

        <section id="CodeSnippetBrowsing">
          <title>Code Snippet Browsing</title>

          <para>The welcome page of the Code Snippet Library classifies the
          code snippets by category and by programming languages. The figures
          next to each label indicate the number of code snippets available in
          each category.</para>

          <para></para>
          <para>You can browse code snippets in 2 different ways:</para>

          <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                        spacing="compact">
            <listitem>
              <para>Navigate through the categories or programming languages
              classification</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Use the Search box in the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Main menu on the left hand
              side or on the upper right corner of the screen. Keywords typed are 
              search in the code snippet title and in the code snippet description.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Matching snippets are shown in a list along with their code
          snippet ID number, title and short description. If you navigated 
          through the categories, there is also a detailed description as well as the
          author&#39;s name. Please note that by clicking on the author&#39;s
          name you can immediately send a question or a suggestion to the
          author of the code snippet.</para>

        <section id="CodeSnippetSubmission">
          <title>Code Snippet Submission</title>

          <para>To submit a new code snippet click on the &#34;Create
          a new Snippet&#34; link in the Code Snippet Menu at the
          top of the screen. Provide the code snippet title and
          description. You can use Web locations (URLs) in the
          description field. &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; will automatically turn them into
          hyperlinks in the final version. Also provide the code
          snippet type, programming language and category as
          requested.  Should a category or a programming language be
          missing when you submit a new code snippet please contact
          the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; team.</para>

          <para>It is highly recommended that you provide a version number as
          well. This version number is a free text field and can have any kind
          of value. Using a version number is useful if you want to post a
          newer version in the future. We also recommend that you indicate the
          same version number in the source code associated with the snippet
          so that &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users can determine whether they already have the
          latest version the next time they visit the Code Snippet Library.</para>

          <para>The code snippet itself can be submitted either by simply
          copy-pasting the source code in the text area or by uploading a
          file. We do recommend that you copy-paste the source code to make it
          directly visible when users browse the Code Snippet library.</para>

          <para>However there are cases where it is ok to upload non human
          readable files. Typical examples are when your code snippet is a
          made of several files that you may want to deliver in the form of an
          archive (zip or compressed tar). Another example is when the code
          snippet is not human readable: simulation software (e.g. LabView)
          use proprietary and non human readable format for their source
          files. In any case <emphasis role="underline">do not</emphasis>
          post pure binary code like compiled C, C++,Java,... The Code Snippet
          Library, like &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;, is about sharing and reusing software code not
          binary.</para>
        </section>

        <section id="UpdatingACodeSnippet">
          <title>Updating a Code Snippet</title>

          <para>To update a code snippet with a newer version of the source
          code, select the original code snippet either by browsing the code
          snippet category or by using the search mechanism. Click on the Code
          Snippet in the result list and proceed to the &#34;Submit a new
          version&#34; link at the end of the screen. Provide a change
          description, a new version number and copy-paste the source code
          associated with the new version.</para>

          <note><para>Please note that even though this is still the
          same code snippet, &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; assigns a new code snippet version ID number to
          each version. So referencing a new version in a Code Snippet Package
          (see section Grouping Code Snippets below) will require that you
          delete the old version and add the new one.</para></note>
        </section>

        <section id="DeletingACodeSnippet">
          <title>Deleting a Code Snippet</title>

          <para>Select the code snippet as indicated above. Then click on the
          appropriate code snippet in the result list. From here you can click
          on the waste basket icon (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
          format="PNG" fileref="../../icons/trash.png" /></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>)

          of the code snippet.</para>
        </section>

        <section id="GroupingCodeSnippets">
          <title>Grouping Code Snippets</title>

          <para>If you have submitted several code snippets that relate to the
          same topic, are written in the same language and belong to the same
          code snippet category it might be a good idea to group them together
          under a common umbrella. This is what Code Snippet Packages are for.</para>

          <para>To create a code snippet package click on the &#34;Create a
          Package&#34; item in the Code Snippet Menu at the top of the screen.
          Provide a title, a description, type, category and version as
          requested. After you submit the form, a new window will pop up
          asking you for the ID numbers of the Code Snippet versions that must be
          added to the package. So before you create a package make sure you
          have the code snippet version ID numbers available.</para>

          <para>Please note that there is a Snippet ID and a Snippet Version ID.
          If you upload a new version of a snippet, the Snippet ID won&#39;t change,
          but the Snippet Version ID will. So when you create snippet packages,
          make sure that you use the Snippet Version ID.</para>

        <section id="UpdatingACodeSnippetPackage">
          <title>Updating a Code Snippet Package</title>

          <para>Like code snippets, packages can be updated. To update a
          package just proceed as for an ordinary code snippet. First search
          for it, select it and finally click in the Edit icon. From here you
          can add/delete code snippet to/from the package. If you want to
          update the package with a new version of a code snippet, first
          delete the old version and add the new one which has its own
          specific code snippet version ID (see <xref linkend="UpdatingACodeSnippet"/>).</para>

      <section>
        <title>&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Developers Channels</title>

        <para>One of the top priority objectives of the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; site is
        to become a discussion forum for the software developers
        regardless of the organization they belong to and the country
        they work in.</para>

        <para>To this end the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team has created a series of mailing lists
        (called Developers Channels) where anybody, including non-&SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users,
        can subscribe. Each channel is dedicated to a given software related
        topic. The creation of a new channel is under the responsibility of
        the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team.</para>

        <para>The Developers Channels managed on &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; offer a number
        of interesting features:</para>

        <para>Discussion Forums are an alternate way to keep in touch with the
        &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; community. The &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Discussion Forums were created primarily as
        a communication vehicle between the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; users and the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Team.
        These are general purpose Forums where you can ask for Help with
        &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME;, suggest new features, new categories for the software map, etc.</para>

        <para>These Forums are entirely Web based which means that you have to
        use the &SYS_PRODUCT_NAME; Web interface to post and read user messages. However
        Forums also offer the ability to be monitored, which means that all
