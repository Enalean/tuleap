 * /usr/share/Smarty/Smarty.class.php.
 * If you specify the path as "smarty/" then it will search
 * the include directories in php.ini's include_path directive,
 * so it would search in places like /usr/share/php and /usr/lib/php:
 * /usr/share/php/smarty/Smarty.class.php,
 * /usr/lib/php/smarty/Smarty.class.php, etc.
