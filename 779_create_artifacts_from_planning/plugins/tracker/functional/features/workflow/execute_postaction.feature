Feature:
    In order to spent less time in my SLA tracker
    As a core team member
    I want some fields to be automatically set
    And I want the workflow to regulate certain values
    
#    Background:
#      Given the tracker has a field 'Status' with two values 'Open' and 'Closed'
#      And it has two date fields 'Closed Date' and 'Start Date'
#      And the tracker has a workflow enabled on this field
#      And a post action exists on the transition 'Open' to 'Closed'
#      And this post action tells that the field 'Closed Date' will take the current date
#      And a post action exists on the transition 'Closed' to 'Open'
#      And this post action tells that the field 'Closed Date' will be cleared
#      And a post action exists on the transition '<new artifact>' to 'Open'
#      And this post action tells that the field 'Start Date' will take the current time
    Background: 
      Given I logon as "testuser" : "tuleap_pass"
      When I go to the Bugs tracker of Test Project

    Scenario: The start date is set to the current date upon creation
      When I submit a new artifact
      Then a message says that 'Start Date' has been set to the current date
      And the artifact has 'Start Date' set to the current date
      
    Scenario: When a bug is closed the 'Closed Date' is set
      When I submit a new artifact
      And I set the 'Status' to "Closed"
      Then a message says that 'Closed Date' has been set to the current date
      And the artifact has 'Closed Date' set to the current date

    Scenario: When a bug is reopened the 'Closed date' is cleared
      Given a closed bug
      When I set the 'Status' to "Open"
      Then a message says that Closed Date has been cleared
      And the artifact has 'Closed Date' cleared
      
    Scenario: Workflow overrides submitted value
      When I submit a new artifact
      When I provide a 'Closed Date' different from today
      And I set the 'Status' to "Closed"
      Then a message says that 'Closed Date' has been set to the current date
      And the artifact has 'Closed Date' set to the current date
#      
#    Scenario: No update perms, no change
#      Given I cannot update the field 'Closed Date'
#      When I switch the field 'Status' from 'Closed' to 'Open'
#      And I do not touch anything else
#      And I submit the form
#      Then a message says that 'Closed Date' cannot be update because of permissions settings
#      And the field is not updated
#      
#    Scenario: No read perms, no change and no warning
#      Given I cannot read the field 'Closed Date'
#      When I switch the field 'Status' from 'Open' to 'Closed'
#      And I do not touch anything else
#      And I submit the form
#      Then no feedback is displayed about the 'Closed Date' field
#      And the field is not updated
#
