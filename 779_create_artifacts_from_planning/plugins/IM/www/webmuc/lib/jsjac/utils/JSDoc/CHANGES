  the file overview if one has been supplied, as well as the source view
  (unless jsdoc has been invoked with the --no-sources flag)

- Added a --no-sources commandline option to not show the sourcecode for
  the JavaScript files 

- Added --package-naming commandline option, which specifies that the path 
  leading to each source file will be preserved. This allows for the same 
  filename to be used in different directories. Using the same class name
  in different packages is _not_ supported (yet)

- Added JSDoc link and creation time in the footer of each page

- Added support for @member tag to explicitly mark a method as a member of
  a class

JSDoc 1.8.4
===========

- Added step in prepocessing to attempt to add missing @constructor tags where
  the 'new' operator is used in combination with a function name elsewhere
  in the source.

- Only the first @extends marking (or assignment of an instance to a sub-
  class's prototype) will be used in determining the base class of a class.

- Updated test.js to show off more features of JSDoc, as well as a general 
  clean-up.

  documentation contains a @class tag (in addition to the @constructor tag)

JSDoc 1.8.3.1
=============

- Some general code cleanup and refactoring. 

- Properly fixed marking of void/non-void methods, and at the same time
  re-introduced recursive regexes (this time non-dynamic, as dynamic seem
  to be much too unstable)

JSDoc 1.8.3
===========

- Changed the handling for __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__
  to define a property instead of a method in the documentation

- Fixed bug in parse_jsdoc_comment that didn't allow for email addresses
  to be entered verbatim (instead, the domain of the address was parsed
  as a tag)

- Re-did the @fileoverview parsing, now other tags and inner {@link...} 
  tags are included. Additionally, if only one file is processed and there
  is no project overview file included, the file's overview (if it exists)
  is used as the project overview. Thanks to Robert Flaherty for input
  and bug reports on this issue.

JSDoc 1.8.2.1
=============

- Got rid of extra '*' with @fileoverview

JSDoc 1.8.2
=============

- Fixed bug where other @tags were included as part of the @fileoverview

  there was a forward assignment of a static value to the class 
  (thanks to Robert Flaherty)

=========

- Remove the GLOBALS class if it is empty

- Fixed case-sensitive sort in index

- Added support for comments with long blocks of '*'s in the opening and 
  closing of the doc string

- Added sourcecode view

- Fixed bug where named anonymous functions were not recognized as methods
  when assigned to prototypes

- Allow for binding static properties to classes before they are defined

- Added @overviewfile attribute for class documentation, inlines html or
  textfiles into the documentation

- Added beginnings of unit testing

- Don't add 'constructor' as an instance or class property

- Added an @overviewfile tag which can be put in an independent 
  jsdoc-comment block at the top of each file. This results in a project
  overview page for each file with an overview, similar to JavaDoc's 
  package pages.

- Added support for Mozilla's __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__

- Return type for methods is now Object, and is displayed instead of the
  'function' declaration. The 'void' type is shown if no return can be
  found in the function and no other type is defined. The defaulting to
  Object also goes for fields, and is shown instead of the 'var' declaration

- Allow usage of the {@link url label} construct for the @type tag

JSDoc 1.6.3.1
=============

  with the @constructor attribute

  otherwise be considered static methods

  not be made to non-existent resources, and parentheses are not placed

- Carry over method documentation for overridden methods if no new 
  documentation has been supplied for the method. This is in following with
  javadoc functionality

- Fixed /* functionality(whatever) bug

- Fixed remaining problems with comments inside of parameter lists

JSDoc 1.6
=========
