TODO for JSDoc

- XML / XMI export

- Improve the --package-naming option so that there are separate namespaces
  for each package (so that you can have the same class name defined in 
  different packages)

- Fix some spacing/table issues in the navbar in the templates (use a td
  border in the stylesheet to debug)

- Introduce a more generalized system for generating the navbar

- Handle additional information (such as @see) for fields

- Uncallable methods/functions should be marked as private, or show the scope
  from which they can be called

- Dynamic handling of assignment of prototype to a temp variable (preprocessor)

- Add support for interfaces, but first this has to be better defined

- Top-level var documenting (maybe add a '@global' tag to force toplevel vars
  to be documented

- Add an FAQ, more and better documentation

- Java port (someday...)

- Make a more polished API for using other doclets, like javadoc

- Add a deprecated page, make deprecated support more like javadoc

- Add support for js files without .js extension

- Support for a time stamp

- Some of the ->{vars} are set to undef, should always be an empty map

- Add command line params --dump-tree, --dump-xml

- Add command line param --stylesheet

- Make navbar links selective so they are never broken

- Update the help doc
