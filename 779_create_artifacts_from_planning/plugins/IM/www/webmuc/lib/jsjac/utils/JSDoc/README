README for jsdoc.pl

jsdoc.pl is a script that produces javadoc-style documentation from well-formed 
JavaScript sourcefiles. At the moment, this means it supports sourcefiles where 
all functions are mapped to a class using prototype-based inheritance. 
Anonymous function definitions 
(e.g. Circle.prototype.getRadius = function(){ ...} ) are supported.

This application requires Perl5, as well as one non-standard addon module:
    - HTML::Template, which is available from CPAN (cpan.org)

Invocation is simple: Just run the application, giving one or more well-formed 
OO JavaScript sourcefilename(s) as arguments. A sample JS sourcefile, test.js, 
is given along with this application. An example of running the application is 
shown below:

    $ ./jsdoc.pl test.js

OR
    perl jsdoc.pl test.js

Further information about using JsDoc can be found at 
http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net

If there are any questions, comments, problems or anything else, please mail 
the jsdoc-user mailing list; more information can be found at 
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=30801. This application has been 
successfully tested on Linux (Debian and Redhat), and Windows 2000 with 
ActivePerl.
