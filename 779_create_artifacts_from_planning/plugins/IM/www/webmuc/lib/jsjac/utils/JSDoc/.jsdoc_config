# The following hashes are used for supplying user-defined @attribute tags
# that will be parsed. Non-standard attributes (such as @subclass) can be
# added into these hashes, along with a code reference. The return value
# from the code reference will be included in the documentation. All 
# non-standard tags that are not in the below hashes will be ignored.
# The code reference will receive a reference to an array of 
# values that were supplied with the @... tag
#
