==== Current limitations ====
- For HTML emails send in Text+HTML (aka multipart/alternative) we can display
  the HTML version only because it's the first attachment we treat.

==== For a future release ====
- Refactor DB:
-- Mime messages tables (esp. multipart/alternative)
-- Store often used headers as table columns (date, ctype, subject, message_id)
