For futur developers/developments:
=== Might be a good idea to add pagination on admin delegation logs ===
* This will require a DB update to add an index on some columns (in order to sort)
* Take the opportunity of the upgrade script to rename the "UserWidget" because
  it's name is too generic (admindelegation).
